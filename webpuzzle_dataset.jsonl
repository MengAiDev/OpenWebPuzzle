{"question": "上下文中的'这个特定的指示词'指的是什么？", "answer": "This", "context": "Unlocking student talent is an approach to personalizing learning? In brief, it’s about putting kids first by giving them “voice and choice” in their own learning. Integrated into the 21st Century classrooms of differentiated learning that vary the “pace and face” of instruction to target the individualized differences. These purposefully-designed student-centered classrooms, encapsulate the accepted concept of personalizing learning. It is when these three components intersect, differentiation, individualization and student-centeredness.[隐藏] is the next generation of the differentiated classroom and the added refinements are clearly outlined: Personalized learning adapts a metacognitive approach that fosters self-direction, self- monitoring and self-evaluation. In essence, personalized learning is student ownership. However, this new model is guided by motivating factors that ignite, invigorate and instill the learning, as well as fostering, metacognitive, reflective, coaching and feedback. Personalized learning means greater student achievement through self-determined change (interests), challenge (goals) and choice (methods). In short, the thrust is to engage students in ways that they become the “stewards of their own learning”. How do we prepare our students for the test of life? We teach them how to learn when they are not being taught! In other words, we give them the gift of self-reflection, self-awareness, self-initiative, self-direction, self-assessment and self-regulation – the gift of knowing when they know, and when they don’t know. Metacognition: The Neglected Skill Set for Empowering Students, is written with the teacher in mind. It is more practical than theoretical, but most definitely grounded in research findings and connected to emergent data. With the 30 ready-to-use metacognitive strategies in this book, teachers will deepen learning for their students through explicit reflections on planning, monitoring and evaluating their own work. As students learn how to “think about their own thinking”, they become more aware and, thus, better able to make adjustments on their own work. They gain a sense of ownership, and teachers get results they can count on through students empowerment. Metacognition is like magic for 21st century classrooms – it changes student behaviors before your eyes. Thinking About Thinking in IB Schools: How We Know What We Know. The quintessential question, “How do we know what we know?” seems to drive the quest for high performing learners to learn more, dig deeper, explore, investigate and in the end, be able to validate and justify. With rigorous principles paralleling the International Baccalaureate curriculum framework, (as well as other recognized curriculum frameworks) drive that inquiry. While “knowledge comes on the coattails of thinking, the Theory of Knowledge approach extends this, as students dig into the evidence-based scenarios about, ”How we know what we know”. This professional learning enhances the work of students with the depth and breath of mega-thinkers. It supports the remarkable curriculum work, with complementary discussions and exercises that provide that added, oomph! Grounded in principles of curiosity, confidence, connectedness, reasoning, communication, reflection and open-mindedness, practical threads of thinking, practicing and performing are ever-present. Empower students with lifelong skills that will impact every sector of their lives. Real world application drives 21st Century, academic learning. In this generation, students don’t learn to do they do to learn. They live in a fast-paced society and are impatient with the slow and steady rhythm of the traditional classroom. How do significant curriculum shifts toward a more relevant, rigorous, inquiry-oriented approach occur within this assessment-driven culture? How do teachers guide kids to dig into authentic problems? How do they support “high-tech” applications in a digital-rich classroom? How do they foster collegial, “high-touch” teamwork on projects and papers? How do they challenge students with rigor in “high-thought” explorations, investigations, and experimentations? “The times, they are a changing”, and they are changing at breakneck speed. How do we, as leaders, retool schools to meet the challenges in relevant ways? Nuggets of info and some great tools . . .the takeaway strategies that can be applied in the classroom immediately w/o a lot of changes to lessons will be all helpful in adding deeper critical thinking. Joey Dale, Middle School. It's time to transform instruction with enriched Problem-based Learning in a Nutshell Here is the big secret about PBL . . . It’s not that complicated! Moving toward relevance in the curriculum that uses 21st Century, real-world applications, student inquiry models are front and center-problem-based, project, and service learning experiences are among the most frequently cited. It’s efffective to get started with tools already familiar to teachers today: graphic organizers, essential questions, rich and relevant content, rigorous thinking skills, digital-rich tools for searching and researching, collaborative team work and presentation skills. Simply put: PBL is like DIY (Do It Yourself) projects- Do It-to-Learn-It, 21st Century methodology, rather, than Learn It-to-Do-It, 20th Century traditions. Great job of not being an educational “expert” yet, being an entertaining presenter. Wish more people had you background and experience to share with teachers. Alice McKay, High School English. Using the Three Story Intellect to assure teachers that students are moving through the three levels of thinking-gathering, processing and applying, students learn to think more deeply. As they become more aware of their thinking, confidence increases dramatically, and the shift from the teacher-directed classroom environment to a student-centered culture of respect, responsibility and reliability is the ultimate goal. Learn how to teach kids to think, critically and creatively. Help students begin earlier, rather than later, to adapt self-dispositions of mindfulness that prepare them for test of life. Grounded in 21st Century thinking processes: productive problem solving, mindful decision-making and creative innovation, students develop awareness and control of their own actions, words and deeds.

{"question": "上下文中的'那位名叫O的女士'指的是什么？", "answer": "Olivia", "context": "UPDATED! Scroll down to see who won! Before I get into the review, the photos and the details, let me say we will have THREE winners for this amazing giveaway which includes a Springfield Girls doll, the Springfield Collection Storage Trunk for 18″ dolls, outfits and accessories to fill it! WOW. Now on to the photos, my insight and how to enter (scroll to the bottom of the post to find out how to enter). Let’s start by meeting the Springfield Collection. Maria, [隐藏], Madison, Abby and Emma are a line of very affordable 18″ vinyl play dolls that are similar to American Girl, Journey Girls, Madame Alexander and other lines. The Springfield Girls dolls can be purchased at Michaels craft stores nationwide, along with other stores like A.C. Moore and Joanns. The dolls run approximately $20 and if you use one of the retailers coupons you can get them even less expensive. Their accessories are adorable and make excellent stocking stuffers, gifts for friends, and birthday party favors. The girls come dressed in simple meet dresses and they make a perfect friend for your other 18″ dolls, are great as a starter doll for 你可能还喜欢 a young girl who is just getting into dolls or as a model for your sewing projects. Like American Girl dolls, they have vinyl faces and limbs and soft bodies. The Springfield Girls limbs are not strung like American Girl, rather they are sewn in. The girls have a hard time standing without shoes on, but once you dress them up and put shoes on their feet, they do great! In this photo Abby and Madison are modeling some of the outfits we received for review. Abby is wearing the Plaid Tunic and Leggings outfit ($9.95) with a pair of Springfield Collection Crocs that we already had. Madison is so comfy in the Pajamas and Bunny slippers from the Pajamarama Set which includes two pair of jammies and slippers for $16.99. Madison is very happy to be here and immediately went to the library and picked out her favorite Cecile book and found the comfy chair I had made earlier this fall. This is Maria (some packaging still says Sophia but her name has been changed) modeling the Pop Princess outfit from the gift set while standing in front of the Storage Trunk. The Storage Trunk is made of sturdy cardboard and features two hanging racks and two drawers to keep your doll’s accessories neat and tidy.

Now you can make \"out of network\" calls directly from you mobile phone to anyone in the world. These calls aren't free, though. As in Skype, if you want to use this service to call people on regular phones, you've got to buy credits on the system against them. Rates are either good or great, depending on where you're calling: For example, calling a landline or mobile phone in China is one cent a minute, but a call to a mobile in the U.K. is 15 cents a minute. In order to make out-of-network calls, you call a central Jaxtr number that's local to you, and then tell it who you want to reach. Then it calls you back and connects you--the typical dial-around procedure. But with Jaxtr, you can save the incoming number and use it the next time you want to reach the same person. Skype has shown that a free telephony service can turn its free users into paying customers. Jaxtr also has another revenue stream: It has a free SMS service, in which message lengths are even more limited than normal text messages to Jaxtr can insert paid 40-character-long ads at the ends of messages.

{"question": "上下文中的'消息来源称'指的是什么？", "answer": "据报道", "context": "about ten years ago , a peculiar dynamical phenomenon was discovered in populations of identical phase oscillators : under nonlocal symmetric coupling , the coexistence of coherent ( synchronized ) and incoherent oscillators was observed @xcite . this highly counterintuitive phenomenon was given the name chimera state after the greek mythological creature made up of different animals @xcite . since then the study of chimera states has been the focus of extensive research in a wide number of models , from kuramoto phase oscillators @xcite to periodic and chaotic maps @xcite , as well as stuart - landau oscillators @xcite . the first experimental evidence of chimera states was found in populations of coupled chemical oscillators as well as in optical coupled - map lattices realized by liquid - crystal light modulators @xcite . recently , moreover , martens and coauthors showed that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition between two antagonistic synchronization patterns in a mechanical experiment involving two subpopulations of identical metronomes coupled in a hierarchical network @xcite . in the context of neuroscience , a similar effort has been undertaken by several groups , since it is believed that chimera states might explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in many birds and dolphins which sleep with one eye open , meaning that one hemisphere of the brain is synchronouns whereas the other is asynchronous @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to make a contribution in this direction , by identifying for the first time a variety of single and multi - chimera states in networks of non - locally coupled neurons represented by hindmarsh rose oscillators . recently , multi - chimera states were discovered on a ring of nonlocally coupled fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) oscillators @xcite . the fhn model is a 2dimensional ( 2d ) simplification of the physiologically realistic hodgkin - huxley model @xcite and is therefore computationally a lot simpler to handle . however , it fails to reproduce several important dynamical behaviors shown by real neurons , like rapid firing or regular and chaotic bursting . this can be overcome by replacing the fhn with another well - known more realistic model for single neuron dynamics , the hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) model @xcite , which we will be used throughout this work both in its 2d and 3d versions . in section 2 of this paper , we first treat the case of 2d - hr oscillators represented by two first order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) describing the interaction of a membrane potential and a single variable related to ionic currents across the membrane under periodic boundary conditions . we review the dynamics in the 2d plane in terms of its fixed points and limit cycles , coupling each of the @xmath0 oscillators to @xmath1 nearest neighbors symmetrically on both sides , in the manner adopted in @xcite , through which chimeras were discovered in fhn oscillators . we identify parameter values for which chimeras appear in this setting and note the variety of oscillating patterns that are possible due to the bistability features of the 2d model . in particular , we identify a new `` mixed oscillatory state '' ( mos ) , in which the desynchronized neurons are uniformly distributed among those attracted by a stable stationary state . furthermore , we also discover chimera like patterns in the more natural setting where only the membrane potential variables are coupled with @xmath2 of the same type . next , we turn in section 3 to the more realistic 3d - hr model where a third variable is added representing a slowly varying current , through which the system can also exhibit bursting modes . here , we choose a different type of coupling where the two first variables are coupled symmetrically to @xmath2 of their own kind and observe only states of complete synchronization as well as mos in which desynchronized oscillators are interspersed among neurons that oscillate in synchrony . however , when coupling is allowed only among the first ( membrane potential ) variables chimera states are discovered in cases where spiking occurs within sufficiently long bursting intervals . finally , the paper ends with our conclusions in section 4 . following the particular type of setting proposed in @xcite we consider @xmath0 nonlocally coupled hindmarsh - rose oscillators , where the interconnections between neurons exist with @xmath3 nearest neighbors only on either side as follows : @xmath4 \\label{eq:01 } \\\\ \\dot y_k & = & 1 - 5x_k^2-y_k+ \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2r}\\sum_{j = k - r}^{j = k+r } [ b_{yx}(x_j - x_k)+b_{yy}(y_j - y_k ) ] . \\label{eq:02 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations @xmath5 is the membrane potential of the @xmath6-th neuron , @xmath7 represents various physical quantities related to electrical conductances of the relevant ion currents across the membrane , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constant parameters , and @xmath11 is the external stimulus current . each oscillator is coupled with its @xmath12 nearest neighbors on both sides with coupling strengths @xmath13 . this induces nonlocality in the form of a ring topology established by considering periodic boundary conditions for our systems of odes . as in @xcite , our system contains not only direct @xmath14 and @xmath15 coupling , but also cross - coupling between variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 . this feature is modeled by a rotational coupling matrix : @xmath18 depending on a coupling phase @xmath19 . in what follows , we study the collective behavior of the above system and investigate , in particular , the existence of chimera states in relation to the values of all network parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . more specifically , we consider two cases : ( @xmath22 ) direct and cross - coupling of equal strength in both variables ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) direct coupling in the @xmath16 variable only ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) . similarly to @xcite we shall use initial conditions randomly distributed on the unit circle ( @xmath27 ) . at @xmath28 of eqs . ( [ eq:01]),([eq:02 ] ) ( left ) and selected time series ( right ) for @xmath29 . ( a ) @xmath30 , ( b ) @xmath31 and ( c ) @xmath32 . @xmath33 and @xmath34.,scaledwidth=70.0% ] typical spatial patterns for case ( @xmath22 ) are shown on the left panel of fig . [ fig : fig1 ] , where the @xmath16 variable is plotted over the index number @xmath6 at a time snapshot chosen after a sufficiently long simulation of the system . in this figure the effect of different values of the phase @xmath19 is demonstrated while the number of oscillators @xmath0 and their nearest neighbors @xmath3 , as well as the coupling strengths @xmath23 are kept constant . for example , for @xmath30 ( fig . [ fig : fig1](a ) ) an interesting novel type of dynamics is observed that we shall call `` mixed oscillatory state '' ( mos ) , whereby nearly half of the @xmath5 are attracted to a fixed point ( at this snapshot they are all at a value near @xmath35 ) , while the other half are oscillating interspersed among the stationary ones . from the respective time series ( fig . [ fig : fig1](a ) , right ) it is clear that the former correspond to spiking neurons whereas the latter to quiescent ones . this interesting mos phenomenon is due to the fact that , in the standard parameter values we have chosen , the uncoupled hr oscillators are characterized by the property of _ bistability_. clearly , as shown in the phase portrait of fig . [ fig : fig2 ] , each oscillator possesses three fixed points : the leftmost fixed point is a stable node corresponding to the resting state of the neuron while the other two correspond to a saddle point and an unstable node and are therefore repelling . for @xmath11 ( which is the case here ) a stable limit cycle also exists which attracts many of the neurons into oscillatory motion , rendering the system bistable and producing the dynamics observed in fig . [ fig : fig1](a ) . now , when a positive current @xmath36 is applied , the @xmath16-nullcline is lowered such that the saddle point and the stable node collide and finally vanish . in this case the full system enters a stable limit cycle associated with typical spiking behaviour . similar complex patterns including mos and chimeras have been observed in this regime as well . . three fixed points coexist with a stable limit cycle.,scaledwidth=40.0% ] for @xmath31 , on the other hand , there is a `` shift '' in the dynamics of the individual neurons into the spiking regime , as seen in fig . [ fig : fig1](b ) ( right ) . the corresponding spatial pattern has a wave - like form of period 2 . then , for @xmath32 a classical chimera state with two incoherent domains is observed ( ( fig . [ fig : fig1](c ) , left ) . diagonal coupling ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) is , therefore , identified as the necessary condition to achieve chimera states . by contrast , it is interesting to note that in nonlocally coupled fitz - hugh nagumo oscillators @xcite it has been shown both analytically and numerically that chimera states occur for _ off - diagonal _ coupling . by decreasing the range of coupling @xmath3 and increasing the system size @xmath0 , chimera states occur with multiple domains of incoherence and coherence for @xmath32 ( fig . [ fig : fig3](c , d ) ) , and , accordingly , periodic spatial patterns with larger wave numbers arise for @xmath31 , as seen in fig . [ fig : fig3](a , b ) . this is in agreement with previous works reported in @xcite . next we consider the case ( @xmath24 ) where the coupling term is restricted to the @xmath16 variable . this case is important since incorporating the coupling in the voltage membrane ( @xmath16 ) alone is more realistic from a biophysiological point of view . in fig . [ fig : fig4 ] spatial plots ( left ) and the corresponding @xmath39-plane ( right ) for increasing coupling strength are shown . chimera states ( fig . [ fig : fig4 ] ( b , c ) ) are observed as an intermediate pattern between desynchronization ( fig . [ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) ) and complete synchronization ( fig . [ fig : fig4 ] ( d ) ) . of eqs . ( [ eq:01]),([eq:02 ] ) at @xmath28 for @xmath23 . @xmath40 ( top ) and @xmath41 ( bottom ) whereas @xmath31 ( left ) and @xmath32 ( right ) . in ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath42 , in ( c ) @xmath43 , and in ( d ) @xmath44.,scaledwidth=50.0% ] ( left ) and in the @xmath45-plane ( right ) of eqs .

( a ) @xmath46 , ( b ) @xmath47 , ( c ) @xmath48 and ( d ) @xmath49.,scaledwidth=40.0% ] in order to complete our study of the hindmarsh - rose model we shall consider , in this section , its three - dimensional version . the corresponding equations read : @xmath50 the extra variable @xmath51 represents a slowly varying current , which changes the applied current @xmath52 to @xmath53 and guarantees firing frequency adaptation ( governed by the parameter @xmath54 ) as well as the ability to produce typical bursting modes , which the 2d model can not reproduce . parameter @xmath55 controls the transition between spiking and bursting , parameter @xmath56 determines the spiking frequency ( in the spiking regime ) and the number of spikes per bursting ( in the bursting regime ) , while @xmath57 sets the resting potential of the system . the parameters of the fast @xmath58 system are set to the same values used in the two - dimensional version ( @xmath8 , @xmath10 ) and typical values are used for the parameters of the @xmath51-equation ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) . the 3d hindmarsh - rose model exhibits a rich variety of bifurcation scenarios in the @xmath62 parameter plane @xcite . thus , we prepare all nodes in the spiking regime ( with corresponding parameter values @xmath9 and @xmath63 ) and , as in section 2 , we use initial conditions randomly distributed on the unit sphere ( @xmath64 ) . first let us consider direct coupling in both variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 and vary the value of the equal coupling strengths @xmath23 , while @xmath0 and @xmath3 are kept constant . naturally , the interaction of @xmath0 spiking neurons will lead to a change in their dynamics , as we discuss in what follows . for low values of @xmath65 we observe the occurrence of a type of mos where nearly half of the neurons spike regularly in a synchronous fashion , while the rest are unsynchronized and spike in an irregular fashion . this is illustrated in the respective time series in the right panel of fig . [ fig : fig5](a ) at higher values of the coupling strength the the system is fully synchronized ( fig . [ fig : fig5](b ) ) . of eqs . ( [ eq:03])-([eq:05 ] ) at @xmath66 ( left ) and selected time series ( right ) for : ( a ) @xmath67 and ( b ) @xmath68 . @xmath33 and @xmath34.,scaledwidth=50.0% ] next we check the case of coupling in the @xmath16 variable alone ( @xmath69 , @xmath25 ) . figure [ fig : fig6 ] displays characteristic synchronization patterns obtained when we increase @xmath20 ( left panel ) and selected time series ( right panel ) . at low values of the coupling strength all neurons remain in the regular spiking regime and desynchronization alternates with complete synchronization as @xmath20 increases ( fig . [ fig : fig6](a , b , c ) ) . for intermediate values of the coupling strength , chimera states with one incoherent domain are to be observed . these are associated with a change in the dynamics of the individual neurons , which now produce irregular bursts ( fig . [ fig : fig6](d ) ) . the number of spikes in each burst increases at higher @xmath20 values and the system is again fully synchronized ( fig . [ fig : fig6](e ) ) . extensive simulations show that the chimera states disappear and reappear again by varying @xmath20 which is most likely due to the system s multistability and sensitive dependence on initial conditions . of eqs . ( [ eq:03])-([eq:05 ] ) at @xmath66 ( left ) and selected time series for @xmath25 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ( a ) @xmath70 , ( b ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 , ( d ) @xmath73 , and ( e ) @xmath74 . , in this paper , we have identified the occurrence of chimera states for various coupling schemes in networks of 2d and 3d hindmarsh - rose models . this , together with recent reports on multiple chimera states in nonlocally coupled fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators , provide strong evidence that this counterintuitive phenomenon is very relevant as far as neuroscience applications are concerned . chimera states are strongly related to the phenomenon of synchronization . during the last years , synchronization phenomena have been intensely studied in the framework of complex systems @xcite . moreover , it is a well - established fact the key ingredient for the occurrence of chimera states is nonlocal coupling . the human brain is an excellent example of a complex system where nonlocal connectivity is compatible with reality . therefore , the study of chimera states in systems modelling neuron dynamics is both significant and relevant as far as applications are concerned . moreover , the present work is also important from a theoretical point of view , since it verifies the existence of chimera states in coupled bistable elements , while , up to now , it was known to arise in oscillator models possessing a single attracting state of the limit cycle type . finally , we have identified a novel type of mixed oscillatory state ( mos ) , in which desynchronized neurons are interspersed among those that are either stationary or oscillate in synchrony . as a continuation of this work , it is very interesting to see whether chimeras and mos states appear also in networks of _ populations _ of hindmarsh - rose oscillators , which are currently under investigation . the authors acknowledge support by the european union ( european social fund esf ) and greek national funds through the operational program `` education and lifelong learning '' of the national strategic reference framework ( nsrf ) - research funding program : thales . investing in knowledge society through the european social fund . funding was also provided by ninds r01 - 40596 . hagerstrom , a. m. , thomas , e. , roy , r. , hvel , p. , omelchenko , i. & schll , e.

{"question": "上下文中的'消息来源称'指的是什么？", "answer": "据报道", "context": "coherent control of atomic and molecular dynamics using optical fields has attracted much attention , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . thus far , most theoretical work has focused on the idealized case of isolated systems , where loss of quantum phase information due to decoherence , i.e. coupling to the environment , is ignored . such effects are , however , crucial to control in realistic systems , since loss of phase information results in loss of control . for this reason efforts to understand control in external environments @xcite @xcite and to compensate for the resultant decoherence ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) are of great interest . there exist a number of basic interference schemes@xcite that embody the essence of coherent control . one is the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 photon scenario where control results from interference between state excitation using @xmath0 and @xmath1 photons simultaneously . in this letter we provide an analytic solution for control in the two - level @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 photon control scenario in the presence of decoherence . for simplicity , we examine the 1 vs. 3 photon case , although the solutions obtained below apply equally well to the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 photon case , with obvious changes in the input rabi frequencies and relative laser phases . in 1 vs. 3 photon control@xcite a continuous wave electromagnetic field composed of a superposition of a fundamental and third harmonic wave is incident on a system . by varying the relative phase and amplitude of the fundamental and the third harmonic one can alter the population of the state excited by the incident field . clearly , decoherence can be expected to diminish the 1 vs. 3 photon induced interference , and hence the control over excitation . although extensive theoretical @xcite - @xcite and experimental @xcite - @xcite studies have been carried out on the 1 vs. 3 photon coherent control scenario , there has been no serious examination of the stability of this control scheme in an external environment , barring a derivation of a simple analytical expression for the autoionization of a two - level atomic system for weak laser intensities , using the rate approximation @xcite . amongst the various possible influences of an environment on a system we focus on the loss of phase coherence , that is , dephasing . dephasing is expected to occur on a time scale more relevant to control , since the duration of control field can be on the order of a picosecond or less , wheras the typical time scale for energy transfer is considerably longer @xcite . in this paper we show that the 1 vs. 3 photon phase control scenario ( which controls the population ) in a two - level system , when coupled to an environment , reduces to the analytically soluble monochromatic field case , but with an effective rabi frequency that is determined by the relative phase and amplitudes of the two fields . sample results for control as a function of relative laser phase in the presence of dephasing are then provided . the possiblity of solving the off - resonance case is also noted . consider a two - level bound system interacting with an continuous wave ( cw ) electromagnetic field and assume that the energy levels undergo random stark shifts without a change of state during collisions with an external bath , e.g. , elastic collisions between atoms in a gas . the cw field @xmath2 is treated classically , and the ground and the excited energy eigenstates states , of energy @xmath3 and @xmath4 are denoted @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . in general , the system density operator @xmath7 obeys the liouville equation , @xmath8-{\\mr}\\rho . \\label{liouville12l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 , where the free atomic hamiltonian term is @xmath10 and the atom - field interaction term within the dipole approximation is @xmath11\\ ] ] with electric dipole operator @xmath12 . the second term in eq . ( [ liouville12l ] ) , @xmath13 , is a dissipative term that can have a variety of nonequivalent forms associated with various master equations . below we assume simple exponential dephasing of the off - diagonal @xmath14 . in the simplest 1 vs. 3 control scenario , a two - level system is subject to the linearly polarized laser field : @xmath15 , \\label{efield2l } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the real time - independent amplitude and @xmath17 is the phase of the corresponding field , with @xmath18 . here the subscripts @xmath19 denotes the fundamental and its third harmonic , and @xmath20 denotes the complex conjugate of the terms that precede it . the fields have frequencies @xmath21 and @xmath22 , chosen so that the third - harmonic and the three fundamental photons are on resonance with the transition from the ground state @xmath5 to the excited state @xmath6 . in the standard scenario @xcite , control is obtained by changing the relative phase and amplitudes of two fields , which results in the alteration of the degree of interference between the two pathways to the excited state . within the rotating - wave approximation , the slowly varying density - matrix elements of the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 obey the following set of equations : @xmath26\\nonumber\\\\ \\pd { \\sigma_{22}}{t}&= & { \\mrm{im } } [ ( { \\mu}_{12}^{(3)}{\\mathcal{e}}_f ^3 /\\hbar+ { \\mu}_{12}{\\mathcal{e}}_h e^{i\\phi } /\\hbar)\\sigma_{21 } ] , \\label{density_matrix112l}\\nonumber\\\\ \\pd { \\sigma_{21}}{t}&=&-\\gamma_{{p } } \\sigma_{21 } + \\frac{i}{2 } ( { \\mu}_{21}^{(3)}{\\mathcal{e}}_f ^3 /\\hbar+ { \\mu}_{21}{\\mathcal{e}}_h e^{-i\\phi } /\\hbar)(\\sigma_{11}-\\sigma_{22 } ) , \\label{density_matrix212l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the dephasing rate , @xmath29 is the frequency difference between levels @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the one - photon matrix element for the harmonic field and the effective three - photon matrix element for the fundamental field for the @xmath35 transition . below , we use @xmath36 and @xmath37 , omitting the subscripts for simplicity . the controllable relative phase is @xmath38 . it is convenient to define the one- and three - photon rabi frequencies by @xmath39 and @xmath40 given in terms of their amplitudes and phases , by @xmath41 and @xmath42 . note that , although @xmath43 and @xmath44 are real for a bound system , we derive all the equations under the assumption that they can be complex so that the analysis can be extended to complex matrix elements arising in transitions to the continuum . since @xmath45 and @xmath46 are real and positive , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath49 to amalgamate these rabi frequencies and the relative laser phase of @xmath50 , we define the effective rabi frequency @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath51 is real and positive . here @xmath51 and @xmath53 are related to @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath56/ [ { \\cos{(\\phi+\\theta_h)}+\\frac{|\\omega_f|}{|\\omega_h|}\\cos{\\theta_f}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 it is worth noting some features of @xmath51 that are evident from eq . ( [ omegaeff3 ] ) . first , the total excitation probability obtained in lowest order perturbation theory for 1 vs. 3 photon phase control in a two - level system @xcite is proportional to @xmath51 . hence , @xmath51 can be used to predict the controlled population , and its dependence on @xmath50 , when the fields are weak . further ( see below ) , @xmath51 plays a major role in determining the transient behavior of the excited state population for any field intensity in the absence or presence of dephasing . second , the interference term in eq . ( [ omegaeff3 ] ) can be controlled by varying @xmath58 , that is , by manipulating the relative phase @xmath50 of the two fields . since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are real in a bound system , possible values of @xmath59 are 0 and @xmath60 . when @xmath59=0 , , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . on the other hand , when @xmath63 , , @xmath64 , @xmath65 . thus , opposite interference effects are observed depending on the signs of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . third , @xmath66 . if @xmath67 , the smallest @xmath51 is not zero , and thus complete destructive interference , that is , zero excitation from the ground to the excited state , does not occur . rewriting eq . ( [ density_matrix212l ] ) in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath53 , @xmath68 \\\\ \\pd { \\sigma_{22}}{t}&= & { \\mrm{im } } [ \\omega_{\\rm{eff } } e^{i\\theta } \\sigma_{21 } ] , \\label{redensity_matrix112l}\\\\ \\pd { \\sigma_{21}}{t}&=&-\\gamma_{{p } } \\sigma_{21 } + \\frac{i}{2 } [ { \\omega_{\\rm{eff}}}e^{-i\\theta } ] ( \\sigma_{11}-\\sigma_{22 } ) . \\label{redensity_matrix212l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and introducing @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , gives @xmath72 the resultant equations are now of standard form@xcite , but with @xmath51 replacing the rabi frequency of the single field case discussed in ref @xcite . note that the longtime steady - state solution to eqs . ( [ cut ] ) to ( [ cwt ] ) is found by setting @xmath730 , giving @xmath740 . this implies that , regardless of initial conditions and for sufficiently large time , pure dephasing leads to an equilibrium state with equal populations in the ground and the excited states and with no remaining coherence . substituting eq . ( [ cvt ] ) into eq . ( [ cwt ] ) gives a simple equation for @xmath75 : @xmath76 in the important case where initially the ground state is populated and the coherence is zero [ i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , the excited state population @xmath79 is given by @xmath80+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ , & { \\mrm{for } } & \\gamma_{\\mrm{p } } < 2\\omega_{\\rm{eff } } , \\label{oscillation } \\\\ \\rho_{22}=\\frac{[-\\lambda_2 e^{\\lambda_1 t}+\\lambda_1 e^{\\lambda_2 t } ] } { 2(\\lambda_2-\\lambda_1)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , & { \\mrm{for } } & \\gamma_{{p } } > 2\\omega_{\\rm{eff } } , \\label{mono}\\\\ \\rho_{22}=-\\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\gamma_{{p } } t}{2}}}{2}(1+\\frac{\\gamma_{{p}}t}{2})+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , & { \\mrm{for } } & \\gamma_{{p}}= 2\\omega_{\\rm{eff } } , \\label{expo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 $ ] . the general behavior of the solution is seen to be determined by relative size of the dephasing time and the period of the rabi oscillation . analogous analytic results can be obtained for @xmath83 which decays with rate @xmath84 . if the external field is intense enough so that @xmath85 , then @xmath86 shows oscillations that are exponentially damped with time . on the other hand , if dephasing dominates over the rabi oscillation so that @xmath87 or @xmath88 , @xmath89 increases monotonically . however , in all cases @xmath86 reaches a stationary value of 0.5 at long times and @xmath90 for short times . the behavior of the excited state population for several values of @xmath91 for a given value of @xmath51 ( here chosen as 2@xmath92 ) is sketched in fig . [ 2lcwanal ] . for @xmath93 , the introduction of dephasing increases the period of the oscillation and causes the amplitudes to decay as @xmath94 . although this is a cw laser field case , we can extract the result for the field being switched off at a specific time , i.e. , a square pulsed laser which is on from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , by examining the population at time @xmath97 . ( this assumes that there are no additional energy levels excited by the frequency breadth of the truncated cw source ) . significantly , one can end up with an increased @xmath89 even for a larger dephasing , depending on the pulse duration . for example , assume that we turn off the field at @xmath98=1 . if there is no dephasing , then the excited state population at @xmath98 = 1 is 0 and is thus less than that of any of the other cases with dephasing . on the other hand , for @xmath99 ( here @xmath100 ) , there is no oscillation ; @xmath89 just increases monotonically towards 0.5 , where the system reaches the steady - state slower with increasing dephasing . if we were to consider a pulse rather than a cw laser field for this relatively strong dephasing case , the excited state population would be expected to increase up to 0.5 with the increase in the pulse duration . typical behavior of @xmath89 and of the 1 vs. 3 photon phase control profile ( i.e. , @xmath89 as a function of generic phase control variable @xmath58 ) for several values of rabi frequencies and @xmath91 are shown in fig . [ control2lt ] . here we assume that the fields are abruptly turned off at the times indicated in the figure captions to produce a square pulse and the intensities are chosen so that @xmath101 , to enhance the interference effects . the effective rabi frequency is then @xmath102 . while @xmath103 leads to a complete constructive interference of the two transition amplitudes , @xmath104 leads to a complete destructive interference , , no excitation from the ground to the excited state . the typical control behavior seen in fig . [ control2lt ] depends upon the pulse duration , as well as upon @xmath51 and @xmath105 . for example , when the field is weak and @xmath106 , then @xmath89 is given by [ eq ( [ oscillation])-([expo ] ) ] @xmath107~~{\\mrm{for}}~~\\gamma_{{p } } = 0 \\label{precos}\\ ] ] @xmath108 hence , the system shows a @xmath109 rule \" . [ a similar rule obtains from eq . ( [ oscillation ] ) - eq . ( [ expo ] ) when @xmath110 and @xmath111 , when @xmath112 and @xmath113 and @xmath114 are much less than one , and for @xmath115 when @xmath116 . ] note also that eq . ( [ precos ] ) predicts oscillatory behavior of @xmath89 as a function of @xmath51 at fixed @xmath98 , as observed later below . the control profiles for small @xmath54 and @xmath117 ( thin dashed lines in fig . [ control2lt ] ) are then seen to be monotonically decreasing from the maximum excitation at @xmath103 , to zero excitation at @xmath104 , i.e. they follow the @xmath109 rule \" . by contrast , for strong intensity ( thin solid lines in fig . [ control2lt ] ) in which there are many rabi cycles during the pulse , the control curve is not necessarily monotonic since the final excited populations are determined by the time at which the fields are turned off . introducing dephasing is seen to lead to a decreased range of control whose magnitude depends on the relative strength of the dephasing and on the effective rabi frequencies , according to eqs . ( [ oscillation ] ) - ( [ expo ] ) . figure [ control2lt ] demonstrates that phase control profiles are strongly dependent on the pulse duration . for weak intensities , as the pulse duration increases , the degree of control improves and the control curve continues to approximately follow a @xmath118 law ( e.g. , eq . ( [ cos ] ) ) . this behavior is seen both in the absence and in the presence of dephasing , although dephasing reduces the yield for a given pulse duration . in the strong field case the control profile varies strongly with pulse duration . in particular , with @xmath119 , if the pulse duration is smaller than the oscillation period ( = 1/2 ) of the @xmath120 case , then @xmath89 decreases with increasing @xmath58 , as shown in fig . [ control2lt](a ) . for the pulse duration greater than that period , the control profile no longer follows @xmath118 and the maximal yields start to appear at @xmath121 , as shown in figs . [ control2lt](b ) to ( d ) . in all strong intensity cases , the addition of dephasing results in a decay of @xmath89 with a rate of @xmath122 for a given @xmath51 . thus the degree of the control worsens in the presence of dephasing as the pulse duration increases . note that the introduction of dephasing leads to a degree of control @xmath123 that converges to 0.5 , where @xmath123 is defined as the difference [隐藏] the maximum and minimum excited state populations . finally , we note that this treatment can be extended in two directions . the most obvious is to extend it to the general two - level @xmath0 photon + @xmath1 photon interference scenario@xcite where the structure of the problem is exactly the same as that of the 1 vs. 3 photon case . the equations above therefore hold , but with the one and three photon rabi frequencies and phases replaced by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 photon rabi frequencies and phases . the second is to consider the more general case that includes the equal detuning of both fields from the @xmath124 transition , i.e. @xmath125 , and where the populations of levels @xmath6 and @xmath5 decay with the same rate @xmath126 .

Yeah, well, NOTHING went wrong that night. A superb top ten show....for the ages, night two Carnegie!! The \"Two Little Hitlers\" guy was the balcony, or maybe way in the back on the floor. The \"Welcome to the Working Week\" was in row CC, maybe seat 110. I saw him. I could probably pick him out of a line-up. I wasn't suggesting the guy was plant. Just that his convoluted shout-out wasn't the first or only way his request was communicated to EC. He actually said something like, \"It's Sunday, Elvis, so welcome us to the working week.\" I didn't really understand what he'd said until EC started playing the song. I can't believe EC would have been able to parse it, cold, from 20 feet away, over the rest of the crowd noise. But he went right into the song without so much as a \"Huh?\" Interesting. You were definitely closer to the source than me. Lisa's face lit up just now when I played this, with goose bumps ensuing. Good times. Paraphrasing W.C. Fields in A Fatal Glass of Beer, last Wednesday night (March 7) in Brooklyn and much of the nor’easter-wracked Eastern seaboard wasn’t a fit night out for man or beast. But Elvis Costello & The Imposters rose to the occasion for the many hearty souls who still braved the elements for the first of four New York area shows (Port Chester’s Capitol Theatre hosted the next three, last Thursday, Friday and Sunday nights). Taking the stage to the perfect choice of Rosemary Clooney’s “Snow,” Elvis & Co.. were on fire from the get-go, rattling off an initial volley of front-loaded favorites (“Wonder Woman,” “Girls Talk,” “Big Tears,” “Miracle Man,” Radio Radio” and “This is Hell”) with such blazing abandon that drummer Pete Thomas seemed on the verge of spontaneously combusting at any moment. But it wasn’t just the band that was scorching. For his last few tours Costello has brought along two terrific backup vocalists in Briana Lee and Kitten Kuroi, and in these shows he’s really integrated them into the set masterfully, particularly the second half, following the band’s departure after “I Want You.” The gals stayed on and stepped over with Costello to a single microphone set up at the front of the stage, crowding him from both sides as they all sang “Alison” to his acoustic guitar accompaniment, the inspired trio turning into a three-way love fest by song’s end. From there they followed Costello to keyboardist Steve “The Professor” Nieve’s vacant grand piano, maestro himself tickling the ivories as he sang “A Face in the [隐藏],” Lee and Kuroi backing him on the title song of his hoped-for Broadway musical based on Elia Kazan’s 1957 film classic starring Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Rather than coming off corny, it was truly affecting, so much so that a good many in the crowd responded in kind. And to top it all off, Costello announced that despite the declining consumer interest in the album format, he and The Imposters have in fact completed a new one for release later this year. That reminds me of the Brodsky Quartet show at Town Hall in New York back in 93. Elvis announced the last number and my buddy yelled out \"Jacksons Monk and Rowe\" really loudly and they played the song again.

{"question": "上下文中的'这个群体'指的是什么？", "answer": "We", "context": "In the silence, things are revealed. Things that cannot be heard in the noise of modern life. For the most part, our culture fears silence because of its revelatory power, both good and bad. [隐藏] do have so many secrets. Usually, the first thing us humans encounter in the silence is our thoughts. So we fear the silence because, we fear our own thoughts. And wouldn’t you know it? The pesky ones we try so hard to push away are usually the first to surface. That’s a drag, so instead we block out the silence. We come home, we go to the fridge and we turn on the tv. We push our consciousness through a kind of predictable tunnel. And the tunnel has a weight, a momentum that is hard to break. It takes a big experience like falling in love or the loss of a loved one to crack open the tunnel. But the thing is, no matter how life altering the experience, we have an uncanny way of eventually finding our way back to the tunnel where things are safe, warm and pretty doggone mediocre. Well, lately, mediocrity is even giving the tunnel too much credit. We’ve sunk somewhere below mediocrity into absurdity. Then every once-in-awhile, in the silence you recognize an exciting thought that leads you down the rabbit hole. It stirs something within you, like the memory of a distant voice. Maybe it is hardly a voice at all and more like a feeling. It stirs you to action. Maybe you write it down. Maybe you make a collage. Maybe you fix something. Maybe you share your idea with another. Maybe you make the bed. Or maybe you just shut up and listen. And then respond. Listen. Respond. You begin to have a conversation with what is. In the silence, our senses unfurl, like tendrils. We hear the wind. Bird. We smell the air, and perhaps notice that when the sun comes out for a moment from behind the clouds on a grayish day, the grass responds to the sun by releasing a stronger scent. Smell the greeting of the grass and the sun. It is all so alive. In the silence, one can slip into the role of the third person who watches. From that perspective, when someone, let’s say, cuts you off in traffic, you become frustrated for a moment, sure. You are yanked back down to a lower consciousness. But if you’ve been practicing as the watcher, you are more easily able to slip back into higher consciousness. I don’t mean to imply that the higher consciousness is a way to avoid emotion. You feel the anger but in the silence, you more easily and quickly move to another place, like finding shade on a hot day. Why stay hot when the shade is right next to you? Maybe to be enlightened means that you live in that higher consciousness all the time, or, I don’t know, 90% of the time. Those people, from what I’ve heard, have had some kind of major divine intervention. For most of us poor schmucks it’s just something we have to practice. It’s hard for a beginner like me and very time consuming, but also cleansing, like a good poop. “And one should never underestimate the satisfaction of a good poop, I always say,” says Mr. Octopus, who is, pretty much, enlightened. It’s called higher consciousness because it lifts you higher. Duh! Sort of like being high, but with better side affects. And I suspect there’s more to the silence than even all of that. It’s exciting. But for now, this is as far as I’ve gotten. So, what the hell? Turn off that tv once-in-awhile. Turn off that radio. Let the emptiness emerge and let the quiet part begin! Whoop whoop! The secrets are not as bad as we think. The truth is always better, even though its emergence is sometimes painful. “Like a poop,” says Mr. Octopus. “Yes, just like a hard poop,” I agree. In silence we can hear the truth of ourselves, and, well, it’s not all bad! Geesh! This entry was posted on Monday, December 13th, 2010 at 3:16 pm and posted in Favorites, Uncategorized.

{"question": "上下文中的'一种编程语言中的条件语句关键词'指的是什么？", "answer": "If", "context": "As a limited company or umbrella company contractor, being able to negotiate effectively on the contracts that you accept is an essential skill. The name of the game is obvious, you are trying to get the highest possible pay rate for the skill set that you have on offer. The challenge of course is being able to sell yourself and secure contracts at competitive pay rates. In general, contractors tend to see higher pay rates than that of permanent staff, much of which is due to contractors being able to negotiate their pay rates as they generally have a specific set of skills that the company is in need of utilising. Therefore, as an umbrella company or limited company contractor, it's always worth your while to polish up on your negotiation skills. In this article, PayStream provide you with our top 5 tips into the art of contract negotiation. Your contract rate can dramatically vary depending not only on your skill set, but also on the industry you are operating in. Industries such as IT and Oil & Gas have experienced a successful boom in recent months giving contractors within these industries the ability to demand much higher pay rates. [隐藏] you have a niche skill set that clients are struggling to source you will find yourself with strong bargaining power, so don't be afraid to use it. Make your potential employer aware that you would be willing to walk away should you not be offered a competitive level of pay. You should always go into the negotiation with high expectations and be willing to compromise, but remember to never undersell yourself. At the same time it is important to ensure you remain fair with your contract rates, if you overprice and under deliver, you could cause a lot of harm to your reputation and long term success. In order to negotiate effectively, it is essential to be aware of current industry pay rates for your job title and skills set. If not you could fall victim to consultant pay rate estimations which could result in you earning less than you're worth. It is important to remember that pay rates change over time and can vary depending on region so it is important to keep up to date. One of the best ways to seek industry averages is by asking other contractors operating in the same field as you, giving you an industry average benchmark. Utilise seminars, training days and online training programs to your advantage so that you continually add value to your skills set. Not only does this improve your ability to do your job better than other contractors but, when pitching to potential clients, you're enhanced skills set and industry knowledge will give you greater leeway to negotiate higher pay rates. When first starting out as a limited company or umbrella company contractor it can be easy to slip into the routine of accepting every contract you get offered, be it big or small, in order to maximise your overall take home pay. However, this may not always be the best solution for the long term. Working for well known, larger companies with bigger budgets can not only boost your professional image but could also lead to longer term contracts, which would give greater financial security and more take home pay in the long term. Remember, if you have strong bargaining power, then use your negotiation skills to demand higher pay rates. When negotiating pay rates it can be easy for contractors to set a standard pay rate and stick to it for numerous contracts. This is especially true when a contractor finds themselves taking on a new contract with the same company. However, it is important to remember that each contract should be reviewed in isolation and if the contract requires the use of a different skill set then the pay rate should also be revisited along with the new contract terms. Therefore, when negotiating get a rough estimate to the time, level of work and the skills set needed for each contract and individually quote for your client. Remember following these simple but golden rules could result in higher take home pay. Always aim high for pay rates and be willing to comprise if the contract is valuable to you. Always ensure that you are in a strong position if you are considering walking away should the pay rates not meet your expectations. Finally, don't hesitate when it comes to negotiating your contract renewals and remember to use your skills set and up to date industry knowledge as leverage.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_54", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "As a limited company or umbrella company contractor, being able to negotiate effectively on the cont..."}

{"question": "上下文中的'用来表示支持或目的的英文单词'指的是什么？", "answer": "For", "context": "The first South African surrogate babies - triplets at that - were born on 1 October 1987. The surrogate in this case was the 48-year-old mother of a young woman, who was unable to carry a child to term after removal of her uterus. The future of surrogate motherhood is still uncertain in most countries as very few legislatures have addressed the issue directly. Legal precedents are limited and common law principles do not provide adequate answers to the problems surrounding surrogate motherhood. [隐藏] the purpose of this article, the de jure situation of surrogate motherhood in the United States of America, Britain and Australia will be examined as either their legislatures, or their courts, or both, have been active in this field. The draft convention on the hotelkeeper&apos;s contract: an exercise in the unification of private law? In spite of the fact that the Draft Convention on the Hotelkeeper&apos;s Contract is only a draft which has not yet been adopted by an international diplomatic conference, the period 1986-1988 has been earmarked for its adoption. After that, it will only be a matter of time before the Final Convention is adopted. South Africa will then have to decide whether or not to adopt the Convention as part of its law. In order to take the correct decision, the contents of the Draft ought by then to have been studied in order to determine whether they are compatible with South African law on this point and, if there are any deviations, whether these are fatal from a South African legal perspective. This modus operandi is consistent with state practice. States evaluate treaties and other international instruments by comparing them to related aspects in their own national systems. If this study in compatibility proves to be in their interest, they will accept these treaties as law either with some clearly indicated reservations or unreservedly. This article is a study on the compatibility between the Draft Convention and the South African law on this point. The role of legal education in a changed South African society is going to be both important and multifaceted. The ingenuity of legal educators (and that of the legal profession as a whole) will be required to devise the fundamental restructuring of administrative units that change will entail. The burden shall be to actively challenge the notion that legal education is, or should be, aimed at producing persons destined solely for legal practice. The consequent increase in the demand for a legal education will place a great strain on the resources available to legal educators. The traditional mode of providing a legal education, may need re-examination, with perhaps a greater emphasis on distance teaching of law. Even in relation to our role as trainers of students destined for legal practice, we shall need to devise new approaches to legal education that will result in the production of well-rounded educated persons. Whatever the outcome, the experience of Papua New Guinea suggests that the resultant law reforming activity needs to be sustained. The purpose of this article is to elucidate the meaning of the concept of \"permanent sovereignty over wealth and natural resources\" as formulated by the UN General Assembly resolutions. From the point of view of public international law, it is of interest to ascertain the legal status and effect of this concept. An attempt will be made to answer the question whether the concept of \"permanent sovereignty over wealth and natural resources\" means anything more than a reference to the sovereign state&apos;s right of nationalisation or expropriation of foreign property rights located within its territorial jurisdiction. Today, the area of drugs and drug product liability is a complex, ever changing synthesis of medicine and the law. Drugs are now recognised as inherently dangerous with potential for causing harm. The majority of today&apos;s prescription drugs hardly existed twenty years ago. In this age of chemotherapy, masses of the population are vaccinated or innoculated against diseases, and few, if any, individuals, do not at some time or another make use of medical prescriptions. It is then only to be expected that courts will at one time or another be flooded with cases of alleged injuries suffered from the use of such drugs. Such an avalanche of litigation did occur in the United States of America, but did not materialise in Commonwealth jurisdictions.There appears to be no legal obligation on medical practitioners to report any adverse drug reactions, and the data on reported incidents must be considered incomplete. A number of reasons may be advanced for this lack of reporting. Of the legal systems of the former three High Commission Territories in Southern Africa, that of Lesotho lies in between that of Swaziland with its strict dualism and that of Botswana which, though still dualist, shows overt signs of developing into a unified system. Of the three countries, Lesotho has by far the most involved set of internal conflict rules which, unlike the position in Botswana and Swaziland, have, for the most part, been formulated by the superior courts. On the other hand, of the three countries Lesotho has progressed farthest in the direction of a unified court structure. This is of the greatest importance as history elsewhere has shown that a unified judiciary leads towards unification of law. However, unification is not something which should, or indeed could, be forced upon the public. It is a long-term endeavour which depends for its successful outcome upon a carefully planned law reform programme which seeks community participation and support.

In arguments before Mehta in May, the two sides clashed over the scope of the market in which the companies compete.

Around this time last year, around my birthday, it was good for me but it was wild for me too, because I felt like something wasn't all the way connecting with my energy. I'm big on energy.

I was blessed enough to talk to some super spiritual people. They made me realize one thing I was missing in my life, and the one thing I was missing was clarity.

The relationships around me, the people I was growing up with, I had a lot of toxic relationships around me. Even the relationship with my mom. I was getting to a point where we wasn't talking like that. It was weird, because that had never been like that with me and her. I realized it had all started with me, and I had to analyze myself, I couldn't point the finger at anybody else. I had to point it at myself, and nurture the relationships that were important to me. But most importantly, nurture the relationship with myself.\" In the final segment of the message, Sean looks to the future, expressing an interest to return to music with a renewed sense of focus. \"I started realizing, you can't depend on somebody for love and a good time and all that if you can't give it to yourself,\" he says. \"I started doing things by myself, doing things I never thought I'd do, like going skydiving or whatever I thought was fun. In the midst I definitely re-discovered myself. Found a whole new energy, and me being a source of it and not somebody else. \"Then I started getting back to making the music, and having fun, started nurturing those relationships that were important to me,\" he continues. \"Putting time into that unconditional love. Conditional love is cool, the money and instant gratification, but the foundation on which you stand on is the unconditional love. Hey man, put the energy back into yourself, be clear about what you want to do, how you want to do it. Just know that it all translates to happiness. It feels good to be back at a higher level.\" The series of videos put Big Sean's prior absence into perspective, and it's nice to have the lyricist back in the fold.

{"question": "上下文中的'一位知名的科技创业者和博客作者'指的是什么？", "answer": "Dan Shipper", "context": "Hi my name is [隐藏] I’m a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and over the past 7 months I’ve been covered in TechCrunch (here), Mashable (here), TheNextWeb (here) and others for projects I’ve built both as a solo developer and with a team of my friends. The absolute best way to get coverage from any media outlet is to know someone who works there, or know someone who knows someone who works there. Journalists, especially tech journalists, get pitched every single day by hundreds of people. Their inboxes are overflowing with emails talking about “amazing,” “world-changing,” “life-altering” startups. That means that your absolute best chance to get coverage for your project is to email everyone you know and ask them if they know anyone who writes for a big blog. Don’t be afraid to ask – the worst anyone can say is no. If you don’t know anyone who knows anyone that writes for a tech site, don’t worry. Compile a list of every tech site you can think of, write a pitch and email all of them. The chances of success are low, but you may get lucky. This is how we got covered in Mashable. If you have a product with traction, excited users, funding, or a really good story you’ve just beaten out 90% of the other cold emails that these blogs get. The most important part is showing in your email that you have a great story to tell that would appeal to the blog’s audience. And keep it short – generally your emails won’t be read past the first few sentences. We got on TechCrunch by creating a Twitter account called YC Y U NO and making fun of a bunch of YC startups. Seriously. Now, we had no idea when we did it at first that it would lead to getting on TechCrunch. We did it on a whim just for fun. But for some reason people really seemed to like the tweets we were coming up with, a bunch of YC founders started following us as well as a few TechCrunch writers. From there we DMed one of them and they agreed to write a story about us and our new project. Get the names of some writers that you admire, or think would be interested in covering you and see if you have any LinkedIn or Facebook connections. I know a lot of people who use this as a first step in getting coverage. You might be surprised at how many connections you have that you didn’t know about. A journalist isn’t going to risk their reputation or their site’s reputation covering an app, or startup that doesn’t have amazing design. If anything is even a little bit off with how your site looks, if it doesn’t look professional and current, they won’t cover you. The design doesn’t even have to be complex. My design for WhereMyFriends.Be which was covered on Mashable was actually really minimalist. But it has to inspire enough confidence from the writer to go out on a limb for. I think the most important thing to realize is that it’s not some insurmountable feat to get coverage. Tech sites are run by real people too, and if you show them that you have a great story, and a great product your chances of success increase exponentially. Persistence doesn’t hurt either. That being said, don’t pin your hopes on coverage. It’s a huge rush to get it, but the road to success doesn’t always start with TechCrunch and in fact often doesn’t. A few days ago I put together a small app in Rails called DomainPolish. When I was finished with it I posted it to Hacker News. It made the bottom part of the front page for a little while – at one point there were as many as 30 people concurrently on the site. I waited for the sales to roll in. None came that Friday night. On Saturday too, there was a fair amount of traffic coming onto the site but, still, no sales. Then Sunday came. It was about 4 in the afternoon and I was thinking about what kind of project I wanted to work on next. The first sale came in. I went nuts. Then another sale came in and I was happy as can be. I had set a goal for myself to make $5 that weekend and I had fulfilled it. And then the person who made the second sale emailed me. He wanted to write a blog post about the service. I said “Sure!” and waited to hear what he had to say. Well the blog post came out in about an hour, and he loved the service! I was so happy. And then he submitted it to Hacker News. Suddenly I was getting emails left and right saying that I had made sales as it climbed the front page. By the end of the night the blog post had referred 1500 people. I had sold 32 plans. That’s cool. But what was even more cool was to look at how that conversion rate changed (and ultimately number of products sold went down) when I had far more traffic but without social proof. Two days after the blog post I decided to write an account of my experience creating the site. After I wrote it I posted it to Hacker News. Soon the visitors were pouring in, and it stayed as the number one story for at least a few hours. By the end of the night my blog post had referred almost 3000 people – 49% more visitors coming to the site from my blog post, than from the blog post written by someone else. But the number of products sold from a blog post written by me was actually 50% lower than the number of products sold from a blog post written by someone else. When someone wrote about me I sold 32 plans. When I wrote about myself I sold 15 plans. What does this say? Social proof matters. Your traffic will convert better if there’s someone credible on the other end saying they love your product. Ad campaigns and blogging about yourself are very valuable tools, but in the end they can’t compete with the power of social proof. Hi my name is Dan Shipper and I’m a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. This is the story of how I created DomainPolish a site to get on-demand, inexpensive focus groups to review your website and ended up making $350 with it in two days. It all started when we found out we had made it to the TechStars NY Wildcard Round. The way the TechStars Wildcard works is they take 10 teams who they really liked, but whose idea they weren’t fond of, and give them a week to come up with a new idea with the understanding that at least one of the teams will make it into the program. While we were deciding which idea we wanted to pitch to TechStars, my teammate Jesse Beyroutey (fantastic blog here) started using Amazon Mechanical Turk to get feedback about them. He would post a short description of the idea, and then ask the turks (as they’re called) to give us their thoughts. I was surprised at some the high quality comments we got, and I was fascinated by the power of the concept.

{"question": "上下文中的'消息来源称'指的是什么？", "answer": "据报道", "context": "in the first part of our paper @xcite , extending an approach formulated in ref . @xcite to the relativistic limit , we have studied systematically the structure of the singularities formed in a relativistically large amplitude plasma wave close to the wavebreaking in a thermal plasma . we have shown that typically the electron density distribution in the breaking [隐藏] has a peakon \" form with a discontinuous coordinate dependence of its first derivative , similar to the profiles of nonlinear water waves @xcite and that in the above breaking limit the derivative becomes infinite . this results in a finite reflectivity of an electromagnetic wave interacting with nonlinear plasma waves . in particular , this is an important property because nonlinear langmuir waves play a key role in the relativistic flying mirror \" concept @xcite . in this concept , very high density electron shells are formed in the nonlinear wake wave generated by an ultrashort laser pulse propagating in an underdense plasma with a speed close to the speed of light in vacuum . the shells act as mirrors flying with relativistic velocity . when they reflect a counterpropagating electromagnetic pulse , the pulse is compressed , its frequency is upshifted and its intensity increased . it is the singularity in the electron density distribution that allows for a high efficiency in the reflection of a portion of the counterpropagating electromagnetic pulse . if the langmuir wave is far below the wave - breaking threshold , its reflectivity is exponentially small . for a nonlinear langmuir wave the singularity formed in the electron density breaks the geometric optics approximation and leads to a reflection coefficient that is not exponentially small @xcite . in the present paper we address the problem of the interaction of an electromagnetic wave with a nonlinear plasma wave which is of interest for the photon accelerator \" concept @xcite and for the relativistic flying mirror \" paradigm @xcite . we calculate the reflection coefficients of an electromagnetic wave at the singularities of the electron density in the most typical regimes of a strongly nonlinear wave breaking in thermal plasmas . as we have seen in the first part of our paper @xcite , in a strongly nonlinear wake wave the electron density is modulated and forms thin shells ( singularities or caustics in the plasma flow ) moving with velocity @xmath0 . in the introduction , in a way of refs . @xcite , we have discussed how a counterpropagating electromagnetic wave can be partially reflected from these density shells which play the role of relativistic mirrors . while in the case of a cold plasma the electron density at the singularity tends to infinity ( see eq . ( 59 ) of part i @xcite and refs . @xcite ) , in a thermal plasma the density is limited by the expressions given by eqs . ( 41 ) and ( 42 ) of part i @xcite . although in this case the density profile is described by a continuous function of the variable @xmath1 , its derivatives with respect to @xmath1 are discontinuous . this discontinuity results in the breaking of the geometric optics approximation and leads to a reflectivity that is not exponentially small . in order to calculate the reflection coefficient , we consider the interaction of an electromagnetic wave with the electron density shell formed at the breaking point of a langmuir wave in a thermal plasma similarly to what has been done in refs . the electromagnetic wave , described by the @xmath2 component of the vector potential @xmath3 , evolves according to the linearized wave equation @xmath4 where we have reverted to dimensional units and @xmath5 the last term in the l.h.s . ( [ eq25-weq ] ) is the @xmath6component of the electric current density generated by the electromagnetic wave in a plasma with the electron distribution function @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath8 for the electromagnetic wave frequency larger than the langmuir frequency calculated for the maximal electron density , @xmath9 , we can neglect the finite temperature effects on the electromagnetic wave dispersion , which have been analyzed in ref . @xcite , in the limit of homogeneous , stationary plasmas . for the water - bag distribution function @xmath10 @xmath11 takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are now dimensionless ( normalized on @xmath16 ) . the wake wave modulates the electron density and temperature increasing them in the compression regions and decreasing them in the rarefaction regions . in fig . [ fig14 ] we illustrate the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath1 for the parameters of a wakewave corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 and for @xmath21 . on the coordinate @xmath1 for the parameters of a wakewave corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 and for @xmath21 . in the inset the ratio @xmath22 is shown in the vicinity of the maximum.,width=302,height=188 ] from eqs . ( 35 ) and ( 59 ) of part i @xcite in the ultrarelativistic case , @xmath23 , using eq . ( [ eq26-ompe ] ) we find for a relatively cold distribution such that @xmath24 that near the wavebreaking point @xmath11 is given by @xmath25 the propagation of a sufficiently short electromagnetic wave packet in the plasma with electron density modulated by the langmuir wave can be described within the framework of the geometric optics approximation . the electromagnetic wave is represented as a particle ( photon \" ) with coordinate @xmath26 and momentum @xmath27 ( wave vector ) . the interaction of a photon \" with a langmuir wave that propagates with a relativistic phase velocity @xmath28 can be accompanied by a substantial frequency upshift called photon acceleration `` @xcite . using the dispersion equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 the wave vector components parallel and perpendicular to the propagation direction of the langmuir wave , we obtain the ' ' photon \" hamiltonian function which depends on the canonical variables @xmath33 and @xmath31 ( see ref . @xcite ) @xmath34 the transverse component of the wave vector is constant @xmath35 and @xmath36 is assumed for the sake of simplicity . the phase portrait of the photon for @xmath37 given by eq . ( [ eq26-ompe ] ) for the parameters corresponding to fig . [ fig14 ] is shown in fig . [ fig15 ] . . the dashed line corresponds to the trajectory of photons that have appeared due to the over - barrier reflection at the crest of the breaking wave . in the inset the photon trajectories in the vicinity of the saddle point are shown.,width=340,height=226 ] along an orbit corresponding to the value @xmath38 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq25-ham - phtn ] ) the photon frequency is given by @xmath39 . \\label{eq25-omega - phtn}\\ ] ] photons , for which @xmath40 are trapped inside the region encircled by the separatrix . along the orbit their frequency changes from @xmath41 and @xmath42 corresponding to the plus and minus signs in the r.h.s . of eq . ( [ eq25-omega - phtn ] ) at the minimum of @xmath37 . photons with @xmath43 are not trapped and for them the sign in the r.h.s . ( [ eq25-omega - phtn ] ) does not change . for trajectories far above the separatrix the photon frequency variations are relatively weak . however a sufficiently strong wakefield can reflect a counterpropagating photon , @xmath44 due to above - barrier reflection ( this trajectory is shown in fig . [ fig15 ] by a dashed line ) . such a photon acquires a frequency @xmath45 according to the einstein formula for the frequency of the electromagnetic wave reflected by a relativistic mirror @xcite . the geometric optics approximation fails when the wakefield is close to wave breaking and this provides the appropriate conditions for a not exponentially weak wave scattering . in order to find the reflectivity of the nonlinear wake wave we make a lorentz transformation to the frame of reference moving with the phase velocity of the langmuir wave . in the boosted frame , eq . ( [ eq25-weq ] ) for the electromagnetic wave interacting with the nonlinear langmuir wave can be written as @xmath46 with @xmath47 } \\label{eq34-az}\\ ] ] and in the neighbourhood of the breaking point @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the coordinate and time and the wave number and frequency in the boosted frame of reference . the coefficient @xmath55 is equal to @xmath56 we seek for the solution to the above - barrier scattering problem for eq . ( [ eq33-ax ] ) writing its solution in the form ( see refs . @xcite ) @xmath57 , \\label{eq40-sol}\\ ] ] where the phase integral is defined as @xmath58 the above - barrier scattering geometry is illustrated in fig . [ fig16 ] . for constant @xmath59 and @xmath60 eq . ( [ eq40-sol ] ) corresponds to the wkb \" solution @xcite . in the following the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 are considered as functions of @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 , because , as explained in ref . @xcite , the mapping between @xmath61 and @xmath62 given by eq . ( [ eq40-w ] ) is one - to - one on the real axis . far from the breaking point , i.e. formally for @xmath63 the function @xmath64 reduces to a constant and the solutions ( [ eq40-sol ] ) are exact , so that @xmath65 as @xmath66 . in other words , the boundary conditions at @xmath63 are @xmath67 since in the representation ( [ eq40-sol ] ) , the single unknown function @xmath68 has been replaced by the two unknown functions @xmath69 , a subsidiary condition is necessary . we shall impose the condition @xmath70 differentiating eq . ( [ eq40-sol ] ) with respect to @xmath62 and taking into account the constraint ( [ eq43-subs ] ) , we find @xmath71 while differentiating eq . ( [ eq43-subs ] ) with respect to @xmath62 and substituting @xmath72 into eq . ( [ eq33-ax ] ) yields @xmath73 the system of eqs . ( [ eq45-bpm1 ] ) and ( [ eq45-bpm2 ] ) is equivalent to eq . ( [ eq33-ax ] ) . it can be rewritten in the form @xmath74 with @xmath75 for @xmath76 given by eq . ( [ eq35-q2 ] ) we have @xmath77 \\ , { \\rm sign}(\\zeta ) , \\label{eq45-sw11}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 if @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 so that @xmath83 it follows that @xmath84 is discontinuous at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) @xmath87 integrating both sides of eq . ( [ eq44-b ] ) and using the above formulated boundary conditions for @xmath88 , we can obtain the reflection coefficient @xmath89 in the form of the infinite series @xcite @xmath90 with the product equal to unity for @xmath91 . the function @xmath92 defined by eq . ( [ eq35-q2 ] ) has a discountinous first derivative at @xmath93 . in the vicinity of the singularity point it can be represented in the form @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 . expanding @xmath97 and @xmath84 in powers of @xmath62 and substituting them into eq . ( [ eq46-rho ] ) we can find ( see eq . ( 27 ) of ref . @xcite ) that the first term yields the dominant contribution to the reflection coefficient , with the result @xmath98 and @xmath99 applicability of the wkb theory implies that @xmath100 . similarly ( see also ref . @xcite ) we can find the reflection coefficient at the electron density singularity formed in the above breaking regime discussed in part i @xcite . in this case the electron density distribution is given by eq . ( 106 ) of part i. using this relationship we obtain @xmath101}\\left(\\theta ( \\zeta ) \\sqrt{\\zeta } -\\theta ( \\zeta-\\delta \\zeta ) \\sqrt{\\zeta-\\delta \\zeta}\\right ) d\\zeta } , \\label{eq - rho - half - half}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 . calculating the integral ( [ eq - rho - half - half ] ) we find @xmath105 consequently , we write @xmath106 from eqs . ( [ eq - r-1 ] ) and ( [ eq - r - half - half ] ) we can see that in thermal plasmas the reflection coefficient is @xmath107 times larger in the above breaking regime than for a wake wave approaching the wavebreaking threshold . generalizing eqs . ( 106 ) and ( 108 ) of part i @xcite , we can write the electron density dependence on the coordinate @xmath62 in the form @xmath108\\ ] ] with @xmath109 and @xmath110 an even number , and @xmath111\\ ] ] for @xmath110 an odd number . it is easy to show that for the reflection coefficient , @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 if @xmath110 is even , and @xmath114 if @xmath110 is odd . comparing eqs ( [ eq - r - half - half ] , [ eq - r - odd ] , [ eq - r - even ] ) for the reflection coefficient with the corresponding coefficients obtained in ref . @xcite , we find that the effects of a finate temperature enter eqs . ( [ eq - r - half - half ] , [ eq - r - odd ] , [ eq - r - even ] ) as a form - factor @xmath115 . in the limit @xmath116 this form factor tends to unity while for @xmath117 decreases as @xmath118 . since the frequency , @xmath119 , and the number of reflected photons , @xmath120 , are related to that incident on the relativistic mirror @xmath121 and @xmath122 as @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the energy of the relected photon beam is given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the energy of the laser pulse incident on the mirror . comparing @xmath127 with the energy of the electrons in the first period of the wake wave ( e.g. see @xcite ) , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the laser driver energy , we find that the photon back reaction ( the ponderomotive pressure ) on the wake wave can be neglected provided @xmath130 . as a typical reflection coefficient value we can take @xmath131 ( see refs.@xcite ) and obtain the condition of relative weakness of the incident laser pulse @xmath132 . as we see owing to the weakness of the photon - wakewave interaction the incident pulse energy can be of the order of that in the driver laser pulse . in the first part of our paper @xcite we found the structure of the typical singularities that appear in the electron density during the wave breaking in a thermal plasma . the singularity in the electron density , moving along with the wake wave excited by a high intensity ultra - short pulse laser , can act as a flying relativistic mirror for counterpropagating electromagnetic radiation , leading to coherent reflection accompanied by the upshift of the radiation frequency . this process implies finite ( not exponentially small ) reflectivity at the electron density singularities . this is provided by the structure of the singularity formed in a relativistically large amplitude plasma wave close to the wavebreaking limit that leads to a refraction coefficient with discontinuous coordinate derivatives . we found the reflection coefficients of an electromagnetic wave at the singularities of the electron density in the most typical regimes of strongly nonlinear wave breaking in thermal plasmas . the efficiency of the photon reflection can be substantially increased by using the above breaking limit regimes which lead to the formation of high - order singularities . we acknowledge support of this work from we acknowledge the support from the mext of japan , grant - in - aid for scientific research , 23740413 , and grant - in - aid for young scientists 21740302 from mext . we appreciate support from the nsf under grant no . phy-0935197 and the office of science of the us doe under contract no . de - ac02 - 05ch11231 . 99 s. v. bulanov , t. zh . esirkepov , m. kando , j. k. koga , a. s. pirozhkov , t. nakamura , s. s. bulanov , c. b. schroeder , e. esarey , f. califano , and f. pegoraro , _ phys . plasmas _ ( 2012 ) - submitted for publication ;

{"question": "上下文中的'你可能还对类似的内容感兴趣'指的是什么？", "answer": "你可能还喜", "context": "the analysis of dynamic processes taking place in complex networks is a major research area with a wide range of applications in social , biological , and technological systems @xcite . the spread of information in online social networks , the evolution of an epidemic outbreak in human contact networks , and the dynamics of cascading failures in the electrical grid are relevant examples of these processes . while major advances have been made in this field , most modeling and analysis techniques are specifically tailored to study dynamic processes taking place in static networks . however , empirical observations in social @xcite , biological @xcite , and financial networks @xcite illustrate how real - world networks are constantly evolving over time @xcite . unfortunately , the effects of temporal structural variations in the dynamics of networked systems remain poorly understood . in the context of temporal networks , we are specially interested in the interplay between the dynamics on networks ( i.e. , the dynamics of processes taking place in the network ) and the dynamics of networks ( i.e. , the temporal evolution of the network structure ) . although the dynamics on and of networks are usually studied separately , there are many cases in which the evolution of the network structure is heavily influenced by the dynamics of processes taking place in the network . one of such cases is found in the context of epidemiology , since healthy individuals tend to avoid contact with infected individuals in order to protect themselves against the disease a phenomenon called _ social distancing _ @xcite . as a consequence of social distancing , the structure of the network adapts to the dynamics of the epidemics taking place in the network . similar adaptation mechanisms have been studied in the context of power networks @xcite , biological and neural networks @xcite and on - line social networks @xcite . despite the relevance of network adaptation mechanisms , their effects on the network dynamics are not well understood . in this research direction , we find the seminal work by gross et al . in @xcite , where a simple adaptive rewiring mechanism was proposed in the context of epidemic models . in this model , a susceptible node can cut edges connecting him to infected neighbors and form new links to _ any _ randomly selected susceptible nodes without structural constraint in the formation of new links . despite its simplicity , this adaptation mechanism induces a complex bifurcation diagram including healthy , oscillatory , bistable , and endemic epidemic states @xcite . several extensions of this work can be found in the literature @xcite , where the authors assume homogeneous infection and recovery rates in the network . another model that is specially relevant to our work is the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model proposed in @xcite . in this model , edges in a given contact network can be temporarily removed in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic . an interesting feature of the asis model is that , in contrast with gross model , it is able to account for arbitrary contact patterns , since links are constrained to be part of a given contact graph . despite its modeling flexibility , analytical results for the asis model @xcite are based on the assumption of homogeneous contact patterns ( i.e. , the contact graph is complete ) , as well as homogeneous node and edge [隐藏]欢 dynamics ( i.e. , nodes present the same infection and recovery rates , and edges share the same adaptation rates ) . as a consequence of the lack of tools to analyze network adaptation mechanisms , there is also an absence of effective methodologies for actively utilizing adaptation mechanisms for containing spreading processes . although we find in the literature a few attempts in this direction , most of them rely on extensive numerical simulations @xcite , on assuming a homogeneous contact patterns @xcite , or a homogeneous node and edge dynamics @xcite . in contrast , while controlling epidemic processes over static networks , we find a plethora of tools based on game theory @xcite or convex optimization @xcite . in this paper , we study adaptation mechanisms over arbitrary contact networks . in particular , we derive an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the asis model for arbitrary networks , as well as heterogeneous node and edge dynamics . in the case of homogeneous node and edge dynamics , we show that the lower bound is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard sis model over a static network @xcite . furthermore , based on our results , we propose an efficient algorithm for optimally tuning the adaptation rates of an arbitrary network in order to eradicate an epidemic outbreak in the asis model . we confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bonds with several numerical simulations and compare our optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures . in this section , we describe the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model over _ arbitrary _ networks with _ heterogeneous _ node and edge dynamics ( heterogeneous asis model for short ) . we start our exposition by considering a spreading process over a time - varying contact graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of nodes and @xmath2 is the time - varying set of edges . for any @xmath3 , @xmath4_{i , j}$ ] corresponds to the adjacency matrix of @xmath5 , and the neighborhood of node @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 . in the standard sis epidemic model , the state of node @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is described by a bernoulli random variable @xmath9 , where node @xmath6 is said to be _ susceptible _ if @xmath10 , and _ infected _ if @xmath11 . when the contact graph evolves over time , the evolution of @xmath12 is described by a markov process with the following transition probabilities : @xmath13[.8\\linewidth ] { p}(x_i(t+h ) = 1 \\mid x_i(t ) = 0 ) = \\beta_i\\ \\sum_{\\mathclap{k \\in { \\pazocal{n}}_i(t)}}\\ x_k(t)\\,h + o(h ) , \\end{multlined } \\nonumber \\\\ & { p}(x_i(t+h ) = 0 \\mid x_i(t ) = 1 ) = \\delta_i h + o(h ) , \\label{eq : recovery}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are called the _ infection _ and _ recovery _ rates of node @xmath6 . in the heterogeneous asis model , the epidemics takes place over a time - varying network that we model as a continuous - time stochastic graph process @xmath16 , described below . let @xmath17 be an initial connected contact graph with adjacency matrix @xmath18_{i , j}$ ] . we assume that @xmath19 is strongly connected . edges in the initial graph @xmath19 appear and disappear over time according to the following markov processes : @xmath13[.9\\linewidth ] { p}(a_{ij}(t+h ) = 0 \\mid a_{ij}(t ) = 1)=\\vspace{.1 cm } \\\\ \\phi_{ij}x_i(t ) h+ \\phi_{ji}x_j(t ) h + o(h ) , \\end{multlined}\\label{eq : cut } \\\\ & { p}(a_{ij}(t+h ) = 1 \\mid a_{ij}(t ) = 0 ) = a_{ij}(0)\\psi_{ij } h + o(h ) , \\label{eq : rewire}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are called the _ cutting _ and _ reconnecting _ rates . notice that the transition rate in depends on @xmath12 and @xmath22 , inducing an adaptation mechanism of the network structure to the state of the epidemics . the transition probability in can be interpreted as a protection mechanism in which edge @xmath23 is stochastically removed from the network if either node @xmath6 or @xmath24 is infected . more specifically , because of the first summand ( respectively , the second summand ) in , whenever node @xmath6 ( respectively , node @xmath24 ) is infected , edge @xmath25 is removed from the network according to a poisson process with rate @xmath26 ( respectively , rate @xmath27 ) . on the other hand , the transition probability in describes a mechanism for which a ` cut ' edge @xmath25 is ` reconnected ' into the network according to a poisson process with rate @xmath28 ( see figure [ fig : adaptive ] ) . notice that we include the term @xmath29 in to guarantee that only edges present in the initial contact graph @xmath19 can be added later on by the reconnecting process . in other words , we constrain the set of edges in the adaptive network to be a part of the arbitrary contact graph @xmath19 . in this section , we derive a lower bound on the epidemic threshold for the heterogeneous asis model . for @xmath30 , let @xmath31 denote a poisson counter with rate @xmath32 @xcite . in what follows , we assume all poisson counters to be stochastically independent . then , from the two equations in , the evolution of the nodal states can be described by the following set of stochastic differential equations @xmath33 for all @xmath34 . similarly , from and , the evolution of the edges can be described by the following set of stochastic differential equations : @xmath35 for all @xmath36 . by , the expectation @xmath37 $ ] obeys the differential equation @xmath38 = -\\delta_i e[x_i ] + \\beta_i \\ \\sum_{\\mathclap{k\\in{\\pazocal{n}}_i(0)}}\\ e[(1-x_i)a_{ik}x_k].\\ ] ] let @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] . then , it follows that @xmath41 where @xmath42\\ ] ] contains positive higher - order terms . in what follows , we derive a set of differential equations to describe the evolution of @xmath43 . from and , we obtain the following equation using it rule for jump processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath44 therefore , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , where @xmath47\\\\ & + \\beta_i\\ \\sum_{\\mathclap{k\\in{\\pazocal{n}}_i(0)}}\\ e\\bigl [ x_i(t)x_k(t)a_{ik}(t ) \\\\ & + ( 1-a_{ij}(t))a_{ik}(t)x_k(t)\\bigr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which contains positive higher - order terms . the differential equations and describe the joint evolution of the spreading process and the network structure . for further analysis , it is convenient to express the differential equations and using vectors and matrices . for this purpose , let us introduce the following notation . let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be , respectively , the @xmath50 identity matrix and the @xmath51-dimensional column vector of all ones . given two matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 , their kronecker product @xcite is denoted by @xmath54 . given a sequence of matrices @xmath55 , their direct sum , denoted by @xmath56 , is defined as the block diagonal matrix having @xmath55 as its block diagonals @xcite . if @xmath55 have the same number of columns , then the matrix obtained by stacking @xmath55 in vertical ( @xmath57 on top ) is denoted by @xmath58 . based on this notation , we define the vector - variable @xmath59 , which contains the infection probabilities of all the nodes in the graph . similarly , let @xmath60 and define the column vector @xmath61 . define @xmath62 as the unique row - vector satisfying @xmath63 note that the length of the row vector @xmath62 and the column vector @xmath64 equals @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of the edges in the initial graph @xmath19 . using this notation , we define the following matrices : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the degree of node @xmath6 in the initial graph @xmath19 . furthermore , we also define the following matrices @xmath69 stacking the set of @xmath70 differential equations in into a single vector equation , and ignoring the negative higher - order term @xmath71 , we obtain the following entry - wise vector inequality for the probabilities of infection : @xmath72 also , stacking the set of differential equations in with respect to @xmath73 , and ignoring the negative term @xmath74 , we obtain the following entry - wise vector inequality : @xmath75 where @xmath76 . we can further stack the above inequalities with respect to the index @xmath6 to obtain the following entry - wise vector inequality : @xmath77 combining this inequality and , we obtain @xmath78/dt } \\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{bmatrix } p q \\end{bmatrix } \\leq m \\begin{bmatrix } p \\\\ q \\end{bmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is an irreducible matrix ( see appendix [ appx : pf : irreducibility ] for the proof of irreducibility ) defined as @xmath80 therefore , the evolution of the joint vector variable @xmath81 is upper - bounded by the linear dynamics given by the matrix @xmath79 . moreover , the upper bound is tight around the origin , since both @xmath82 and @xmath83 consist of higher - order terms . from , we conclude that the epidemics dies out exponentially fast in the heterogeneous asis model if @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined as the maximum among the real parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath79 . furthermore , since @xmath79 is a metzler matrix ( i.e. , has nonnegative off - diagonals ) and irreducible , there is a real eigenvalue of @xmath79 equal to @xmath85 @xcite . in the homogeneous case , where all the nodes share the same infection rate @xmath86 and recovery rate @xmath87 , and all the edges share the same cutting rate @xmath88 and reconnecting rate @xmath89 , the condition reduces to the following inequality : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the spectral radius of the initial graph @xmath19 and @xmath92 which we call the _ effective cutting rate_. the proof of the extinction condition is given in appendix [ appx : pf : thm : stbl : homo ] . we remark that , in the special case when the network does not adapt to the prevalence of infection , i.e. , when @xmath93 , we have that @xmath94 and , therefore , the condition in is identical to the extinction condition @xmath95 corresponding to the homogeneous networked sis model over a static network @xcite . it is worth comparing the condition in with the epidemic threshold @xmath96 given in @xcite for the case in which @xmath19 is the complete graph : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the link - creating rate , @xmath99 is the link - breaking rate , and @xmath100 is a positive and `` slowly varying '' function depending on the metastable long - time average of the number of infected nodes ( for details , see @xcite ) . we first notice that our lower bound in can be checked directly from the parameters of the model , namely , the adjacency matrix of the initial graph @xmath19 and the relevant rates of the model . this is in contrast with the threshold in , since it depends on the metastable average of the number of infected nodes and , thus , can only be computed via numerical simulations . we also remark that the lower bound on the epidemic threshold in and the epidemic threshold in both exhibit affine dependence on the effective link - breaking rates @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . finally , we see that the recovery rate @xmath103 appears in different places in the two conditions , namely , inside the expression of @xmath101 in and inside the function @xmath100 in . however , the consequences of this difference are not obvious , since @xmath100 is defined via the metastable state and , therefore , does not allow an analytical investigation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ] once the cost functions are selected , we must solve the problem of finding the optimal tuning investment to achieve a desired exponential decay rate in the probabilities of infection . from the inequality in , the infection probabilities @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 decay exponentially at a rate ( at least ) @xmath107 if @xmath108 since @xmath79 is an irreducible and metzler matrix , we can use perron - frobenius theory @xcite to prove that is satisfied if there exists an entry - wise positive vector @xmath109 satisfying the following entry - wise vector inequality ( see @xcite for more details ) : @xmath110 therefore , problem [ prb : ] can be reduced to the following equivalent optimization problem : @xmath111 as we show in appendix [ appx : gp ] , we can equivalently transform this optimization problem into a geometric program @xcite , which can be efficiently solved using standard optimization software . the computational complexity of solving the resulting geometric program is @xmath112 , where @xmath70 is the number of nodes and @xmath66 is the number of edges in the initial network @xmath19 . in the rest of this section , we compute the optimal tuning profiles for three different graphs and compare our results with several network centralities . in our simulations , we consider the following three graphs with @xmath113 nodes : _ 1 _ ) an erds - rnyi graph with @xmath114 edges , _ 2 _ ) a barabsi - albert random graph with @xmath115 edges , and _ 3 _ ) a social subgraph ( obtained from facebook ) with @xmath116 edges . for simplicity in our simulations , we assume that all nodes share the same recovery rate @xmath117 and infection rate @xmath118 , where @xmath91 denotes the spectral radius of each initial graph . since @xmath119 , the extinction condition indicates that the infection process does not necessarily die out without adaptation , i.e. , when @xmath120 . the rest of parameters in our simulations are set as follows : we let @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . also , the parameters in the cost functions are @xmath124 and @xmath125 . the desired exponential decay rate is chosen to be @xmath126 . using this set of parameters , we solve the optimization problem following the procedure described in appendix [ appx : gp ] . our numerical results are illustrated in various figures included in table [ table : ] . each figure is a scatter plot where each point corresponds to a particular edge @xmath46 ; the ordinate of each point corresponding to its optimal cutting rate @xmath26 , and the abscissa of each point corresponds to a particular edge - centrality measure . in these figures , we use three different edge - centrality measures : a ) the product of the degrees of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath24 ( left column ) , b ) the product of the eigenvector - centralities of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath24 ( center column ) , and c ) the betweenness centralities of edge @xmath25 ( right column ) . in our numerical results , we observe how both degree - based and eigenvector - based edge - centralities are good measures for determining the amount of investment in tuning cutting rates . in contrast , betweenness centrality does not show a significant dependency on the optimal cutting rates . in particular , for the synthetic networks in rows 1 ) and 2 ) in table [ table : ] , we observe an almost piecewise affine relationship with the centrality measures in columns a ) and b ) . in particular , in these subplots we observe how edges of low centrality require no investment , while for higher - centrality edges , the tuning investment tends to increase affinely as the centrality of the edge increases as expected . for the real social network in row c ) , the relationship between investment and centralities is still strong although not as clear as in synthetic networks . in the scatter plot corresponding to the relationship between the optimal investment and the eigenvector - based centrality in the real social network ( lower center figure in table [ table : ] ) , we observe a collection of several stratified parallel lines . we conjecture that each line corresponds to a different community inside the social network ; in other words , the relationship between centrality and optimal investment is almost affine inside each community . we have studied an _ adaptive _ susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics and arbitrary network topologies . we have derived an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of this model in terms of the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix that depends explicitly on the network topology and the parameters of the model . for networks with homogeneous node and edge dynamics , the lower bound turns out to be a constant multiple of the epidemic threshold in the standard sis model over static networks ( in particular , the inverse of the spectral radius ) . furthermore , based on our results , we have proposed an optimization framework to find the cost - optimal adaptation rates in order to eradicate the epidemics . we have confirmed the accuracy of our theoretical results with several numerical simulations and compare cost - optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures in various networks . 43ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] + 12$12 & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\doibase 10.1038/30918 [ * * , ( ) ] @noop _ _ ( , ) @noop _ _ ( , ) link:\\doibase 10.1007/s00779 -

But there’s a whole lot of good your hygienist does that you might not realize. Here are 5 reasons you should thank your favorite hygienists! They’re a familiar face. Often when you find a hygienist you click with, you tend to stay with them for years! And while you may only see your hygienist twice a year, they get to know you and your family. Some even treat the same family for generations as your family grows and changes, like recently retired Linda Bryant, who served Dental Depot patients for 31 years! They’re your first line of defense. Your hygienist can be counted on to help you with preventative care like cleanings and fluoride treatments, but they’re also often the first to spot signs of trouble like places in your mouth that might be hard to reach or hiding pesky cavities. In fact, it was a visit to a good hygienist that got Melissa Stevens interested in dental hygiene. They are some of the nicest people we know. While we pride ourselves on compassionate care, hygienists take it to a new level. Taking care of your smile is just one part of what they do and for hygienists like Linda Frazier, giving you something to smile about is something she looks forward to every day. They’re constantly learning. Hygiene school is highly competitive but even after a hygienist has graduated, they’re still learning. More than half of hygienists complete 20+ hours of continuing education each year to improve their skills as dentistry evolves. Take it from Tracey Domingue, there are always new goals to set. They give back to their communities. Did you know that 70% of hygienists participate in 1-5 community service events each year? We’re grateful to our hygienists for volunteering their time to participate in events like Dentistry from the Heart. And they even go out of their way to find other ways to give back, like Delano Debro and the ministry he does in prisons. Do you have a hygienist you love?

{"question": "上下文中的'北欧的一个国家的语言'指的是什么？", "answer": "Finnish", "context": "“Frankie Peak” (far right; 2375m) and “Larry Mountain” (right of centre; 2375m) from the summit of “Table Top”. Both peaks were unofficially named by Andrew Nugara in honour of his mother and step-father. Another view of “Frankie Peak” (right of centre) this time from Lys Ridge. We ascended using the ridge that begins in the foreground centre. Our original plan was to make a loop that included “Frankie”, “Larry” (right of “Frankie”), and North Castle (far right – summit not shown). Instead, icy conditions thwarted our trip from “Frankie” to “Larry” and we ended up tagging “Eagle Peak” (centre left) and Whistler Mountain (far left) as an alternate loop. “Frankie Peak” and its twin, “Larry Mountain” are prominent peaks that are located south of Table Mountain in the Castle Wilderness. I had my first good look at them in May 2014 while hiking what I call, “The Whistler Loop”, a collection of unnamed peaks on the connecting ridge between Table Mountain and Whistler Mountain. Later, I learned that my friend, Brad Wolcott, had ascended them as part of an enjoyable trip from Whistler Mountain to Mount Gladstone. In September 2016, my curiosity was renewed while hiking Lys Ridge with Andrew Nugara and Jollin Charest. Andrew told me that he had unofficially named them, “Frankie Peak” and “Larry Mountain” in honour of his mother and step-father. He had first ascended “Frankie” in May 2009 via Whistler Mountain, and then returned one month later using the same approach to summit “Larry” and then North Castle. Therefore, with Andrew’s trip reports as my guide, I began to plan my own trip. The major variation that I wanted to make from both Andrew’s trips and Brad’s trip, was to save distance by avoiding Whistler Mountain on my approach. Like Andrew, I wanted to summit “Frankie”, “Larry”, and then North Castle, but I thought that I could make a more compact loop by ascending a ridge that led up from the South Castle Road on the western side of the mountain. This would save quite a bit of walking distance back to my vehicle after descending North Castle. Joining me for this trip was my middle son, Nathan, who had celebrated his 20th birthday the day before, and was anxious to try out the new backpack that he had received as a gift. Also with us, was Nathan’s (and my other son, Joel’s) friend Keagan, who last joined us on our hike up Morin Peak in the Crowsnest Pass. Keegan basically lives at our house, so I will also count him as one of my mine too. 🙂 I love hiking with my kids! At first, everything went according to plan, especially the ascent which all three of us agreed was a blast. However, after summiting “Frankie”, we discovered that the exposed ramp that Andrew had used to descend the cliff band on the east side of the mountain was covered in ice. To make matters worse, we had to battle extreme wind gusts which made for miserable conditions. So we quickly changed our plans and made a new loop by heading north where we tagged the summits of “Eagle Peak” (“Whistable II”) and Whistler Mountain before descending back to the road – basically doing everything that I wanted to avoid. Nevertheless, neither Nathan nor Keegan had been to these peaks before and I was happy that they still had the opportunity to record their first ever, three peak day. I will definitely return when conditions allow for a successful descent between “Frankie” and “Larry”. Our starting point was identical to that of our Lys Ridge trip. To get here, we headed south from the hamlet of Beaver Mines along Highway 774 until we came to the turnoff for Beaver Mines Lake. Here we turned left and followed the gravel road for ~3.7km until we came to the South Castle Road, which was located on our right. We followed the road for ~600m before arriving at a couple of information signs for the Castle Special Management Area. Also in the immediate vicinity were numerous random camping spots. Here is where things get interesting and unless you have a 4×4 or some type of high clearance vehicle, you will need to park your car and get out your bike. Fortunately, I had my trusty 4Runner so we followed the road across the dry creek bed and proceeded another 6.9km down what at times, was a rough road, until we came to a washed out section just beyond a well marked camping site next to the Castle River. We parked across the road from the campsite. As a side note, almost all of the mud holes that you have to drive through on the road are not too deep, except for the last one immediately prior to the parking area. This is the deepest one (1/2 way up my wheels) and I’ve found that it is the shallowest on the east side – just don’t stop once you’ve started going through! From our parking spot we walked ~100m further to the south along the road until we came to the washout itself. Here we left the road and followed the creek bed east and then southeast for ~550m until we reached the base of our ascent route. We found it was easier to follow the numerous game trails located on the east side of the creek rather than staying inside the bed. When we reached the base, we crossed the creek using a game trail and a couple of well-positioned boulders. From the creek, the initial slope is wide open and grassy. Once we reached the first shoulder, the route narrowed into a ridge and became increasingly rocky and treed. From the first shoulder to the second shoulder, we encountered thicker forest cover and frequent bands of rock – which required lots of route finding. Here we donned our helmets as some sections required hands-on scrambling. The ridge walk along the second shoulder to where it abuts against the main ridge to “Frankie” involved some light to moderate scrambling with most obstacles avoided by sticking to climber’s right. However, just prior to the abutment we encountered a small cliff that would prove to be the crux. I found an exposed ledge to climber’s right, but we found an even safer route by retracing our steps and descending to climber’s left which allowed us to bypass it completely. From here it was an easy hike up a packed argillite slope to the main ridge. The ridge walk to “Frankie” would have been really enjoyable if it weren’t for the extreme wind gusts. To make matters worse, the light dusting of snow on the south side of the mountain had undergone a quick thaw/freeze cycle that made for some slick conditions – nothing that hampered our ascent, but definitely something that we did not want to attempt an exposed downclimb in. From the summit we descended towards “Larry” and found Andrew’s exposed ramp, which in dry conditions would have been great, but not on this day. We could see that to bypass the cliff band, we would have to lose a significant amount of elevation over icy rocks while enduring extreme wind gusts – not fun! So we nixed our original plan and decided to knock off “Eagle Peak” and Whistler Mountain instead. To avoid the wind along the ridge, we descended the northwest face of Frankie and cut across a hanging valley to the col beneath “Eagle Peak”. The ever-increasing wind ensured that we had a miserable ascent to the summit. From here we had an easy but windy hike to Whistler Mountain before descending down the trail to the South Castle Road and then walking ~1.6km back to our vehicle. We loved our ascent route to “Frankie Peak” and I will readily use it again when I return. Be aware though, that at some point in the future, this road will be permanently closed to motorized vehicles as part of the new Castle Wildland Provincial Park. There may also be an overnight option, where a party could knock off every summit from Table Mountain to Mount Gladstone and then North Castle. Indeed, the hanging valley between “Eagle Peak” and “Frankie” would be a very nice spot to camp! Our total distance ended up being 12.5km with total elevation gains of 1323m. From our vehicle to the summit of “Frankie” it was 4.2km. Our total time came in at 6 hours and 41 minutes. Our parking spot on the east side of the road across from the campsite next to the Castle River. I had turned the vehicle around so that it was facing northwest – or the direction we came from. The washout is located just ~100m further down the road behind my vehicle. This was also the same starting point for our Lys Ridge trip. Approximately ~100m south of my vehicle, we came to a washed out section of the South Castle Road. Here we would leave the road and follow the creek bed to the left. Looking down the creek bed from the middle of the road. The first shoulder on our ascent route as well as the main ridge that leads to ‘Frankie”, can be seen in the distance to the right of centre. We found it was easier to stay on the east side (climber’s left) of the creek bed. Here the bushwhacking was relatively light and we could utilize intermittent game trails. A few of the game trails wanted to leave the creek bed too early. We followed this one until it began to head up the western slope beneath Whistler Mountain. It did however, give us our first clear view of the lower section of our ascent route. A telephoto of the previous picture. The Castle is such an amazing place! Looking south down the valley towards Sage Mountain (centre) and Mount Matkin (right). Looking west at our Lys Ridge ascent route. The view to the northwest at “The Amoeba” on Barnaby Ridge (left) and Southfork Mountain (centre). The terrain became rockier as we gained elevation. The hiking is pretty straightforward between the base and the first shoulder. Keegan and Nathan stop to take in the early morning views. After reaching the first shoulder, we began to encounter frequent rock bands (mostly [隐藏] death metal groups who had become lost during album cover photo shoots 😉 ) and heavier forest cover. I couldn’t resist including another shot of the morning sunlight hitting Barnaby Ridge and Southfork Mountain. We had a blast with all of the route finding on this ascent! One of many obstacles that we encountered on the way up. The reverse angle of the previous picture. Morning sunlight spotlights Mount Matkin and 据悉 slopes of Lys Ridge. Castle Peak is on the far left. Typical terrain before reaching the second shoulder. There were many possible routes and we seemed to solve any doubts by trending climber’s right. Nathan and Keegan enjoy a welcome break from the wind just below the second shoulder. After reaching the second shoulder we could finally see where it joined the main ridge. The summit of “Frankie” is not yet visible. The ridge walk along the second shoulder presented easy to moderate options for scrambling. Due to extreme wind gusts, we avoided getting too close to the crest. Nathan and Keegan make their way along the gorgeous little ridge. …except for the crux. It doesn’t look like much from this angle, but it presented us with a small cliff face that halted our progress. I found an exposed ledge to climber’s right, but by backtracking we found an even safer route by descending to climber’s left. Here we could circumvent the crux without too much difficulty. Another look back at the crux. The exposed ledge that I rejected is the vegetated patch on the left. A more comprehensive view to the north. The Whistler Firelookout is on the far left and “Eagle Peak” (“Whistable II”) is on the right. The hike from the abutment to the main ridge was over packed argillite and presented no difficulties. Looking back from the crest of the main ridge as Nathan and Keegan make their approach (lower centre). Our vehicle is parked next to the bend in the river that can be seen in the centre. Once on the main ridge we could finally see the summit of “Frankie Peak”. The summit of “Larry Mountain” is to the left. Nathan and Keegan begin an extremely windy ridge walk to the summit of Frankie. If we had chosen a less windy day, this would’ve been a fun ridge walk. Taking shelter from the wind to consume some calories and put on more layers. Many of the rocks on the south side of the mountain were coated in clear ice. Nathan and Keegan slowly and carefully pick their way up to the summit. The summit of “Frankie Peak”. My GPS read 2370m and Andrew Nugara’s read 2375m. Nathan arrives on his first summit of his twentieth year. Keegan is just behind him. The summit offered gorgeous views! This is the view to the east. In the foreground is “Larry Mountain” and behind it is Mount Gladstone. In the distance is Victoria Peak and foreground right is North Castle. “Whitney Creek Mountain” is on the far left. The view to the northwest. The Whistler Fire Lookout is on the far left, followed by Whistler Mountain and then the “Whistable Peaks” with “Eagle Peak” (“Whistable II”) in the centre. The view north at “Table Top” (foreground) and Table Mountain (right of centre). The view south at a beclouded Castle Peak and Windsor Mountain. North Castle is in the foreground. Our originally planned loop for the day included “Larry Mountain” and North Castle. Looking southwest at Lys Ridge. The summit of Lys Ridge is on the far left and West Castle is to the left of centre. Lys Ridge was one of the best ridge walks that I’ve ever done! In the background is Barnaby Ridge. At roughly the same time that we were on the summit of “Frankie”, a party of 6 hikers had to be rescued off of Mount Haig which is located directly to the west, behind Barnaby Ridge. One of the hikers had been seriously injured and because of the weather (notice the clouds), a helicopter rescue was impossible. While the other 5 made it down the mountain, the injured person was forced to spend the night on the mountain under the care of a public safety officer from Waterton Parks. A huge thanks to all of the people who work in Search & Rescue and to all of the First Responders. Hopefully the injured person will be okay. Keegan and Nathan on the summit of “Frankie Peak”. Always great to stand on a summit with your kids! Happy 20th birthday Nathan! The wind ruined any thought of a lengthy summit stay, so we began to descend towards the col between “Frankie” and “Larry Mountain”. The north face of “Frankie” is really steep! Bypassing the cliff further to the south required a significant detour over slippery rocks – all while hiking into the wind. This is where we changed our plans. Heading back to the summit of “Frankie” to attempt our alternate loop. Looking from the upper northwest slopes of “Frankie Peak” to “Eagle Peak”(right) and Whistler Mountain (centre) – our alternate loop for the day. To get out of the wind and avoid a slow descent along the ridge, we descended the northwest face of “Frankie” and cut across this hanging valley to the col beneath “Eagle Peak” (“Whistable II”). Click to continue to our “Eagle Peak II” trip report. I saw you on the summit of Frankie on sunday; I was on my way there from Whistler, can’t believe we didn’t run into each other!!! We saw you too!! We were in the hanging valley when you were just beneath Eagle Peak. By the time we reached the col, we couldn’t see you anymore. We looked on the ridge to Frankie and still couldn’t see you so we thought you might’ve dropped into the valley. Did you make it past Frankie?

{"question": "上下文中的'关键的'指的是什么？", "answer": "重要", "context": "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) is one of the largest ground - based astronomy projects of the next decade , which will revolutionize several fields of astronomy . a large community of scientists is expected to use alma to tackle several outstanding questions in astrophysics . however , mm / submm astronomy is often considered a field restricted to experts . in the case of students and young scientists in particular , the limited familiarity with mm / submm facilities and observations may prevent them to fully exploit the alma capabilities in the future . these lecture notes are aimed at providing students and young researches some background on mm / submm extragalactic astronomy , with a focus on the investigation of agns . i will first provide a quick overview of the current results obtained through extragalactic mm / submm observations , by focusing on agns ( [ sec_mm_astronomy ] ) . i will then summarize the currently available ( and forthcoming ) mm - submm facilities ( [ sec_current_facilities ] ) . then i will shortly describe alma and summarize its observing capabilities ( [ sec_alma ] ) . finally , i will discuss some of the alma prospects for extragalactic studies , and in particular for agns , both in the local universe and at cosmological distances ( [ sec_alma_prospects ] ) . these lecture notes are far from being exhaustive ; several scientific cases will not be discussed at all ; the main goal of these notes is only to provide an introduction to mm / submm extragalactic astronomy and to highlight some scientific cases that alma will be able to tackle . this branch of astronomy includes observations at wavelengths between @xmath010 mm and @xmath0300 @xmath1 m . longer wavelengths are traditionally identified as radio - astronomy domain . shorter wavelengths , out to mid - ir wavelengths , are unobservable from ground because of the nearly complete atmospheric absorption ( although some sites , under exceptional conditions , allow observations out to @xmath2 m . ) . even within the mm - submm range not all wavelengths are equally easy to observe , since the sky transparency on average decreases rapidly at shorter wavelengths . at @xmath3 only a few atmospheric windows are accessible , and only under optimal weather conditions . this issue is clearly illustrated in fig . [ fig_atm_transmission ] , which shows the atmospheric transmission at the alma site . the main source of opacity at these wavelengths is the water vapor . this is the reason for locating mm - submm observatories at dry and high altitude sites , where the amount of water vapor is much reduced . however , even at these optimal sites there are strong variations of the the water vapor , which make the atmospheric transmission change strongly ( fig . [ fig_atm_transmission ] ) both on long ( seasonal ) and short ( day / night ) time scales . given the difficulties of observing at these wavelengths one may wonder why international agencies are investing so much effort to develop facilities with enhanced observing capabilities in these bands . the mm - submm band contains a wealth of information that can not be inferred from any other band . most of the @xmath0150 molecules known so far in the _ cold _ interstellar medium ( see http://astrochemistry.net for an updated list ) emit their rotational transitions in the mm - submm bands , with a density of about 70 lines / ghz . all of these transitions are important diagnostics of the chemistry , of the physics and of the dynamics of the inter stellar medium ( ism ) from which stars form . some of these lines are so strong ( e.g. the co transitions ) to be powerful tools to trace the dynamics and the gas physics even in distant galaxies . furthermore , some of the strongest lines emitted by the ism of any galaxy , such as the [ cii]158@xmath1 m and the [ oi]63@xmath1 m fine structure lines ( the two main coolants of the ism ) , are redshifted into the mm - submm bands at z@xmath424 . within the context of the continuum emission , the mm - submm bands encompass the rayleigh - jeans region of the warm dust thermal emission ( which traces star formation and the dust mass ) , the high frequency tail of the synchrotron emission ( dominating the radio emission in most galaxies ) and of the free - free emission ( tracing hii regions ) . at high redshift the prominent ir dust thermal bump ( which dominates the spectral energy distribution sed in starburst galaxies ) is shifted into the submm band , therefore making this one of the best spectral regions to search and characterize high - z star forming galaxies . this was just a very quick glance at the scientific motivations behind the development of mm - submm facilities , and mostly limited to the extragalactic field . young stellar objects , protostars and proto - planetary systems are , for instance , additional fields where the mm - submm range is crucial for a thorough investigation . the importance of the mm - submm band within the extragalactic context will become more obvious in the following sections , where i will provide some ( shallow ) background on what we currently know of external galaxies based on mm - submm observations , and where some extragalactic alma science cases will be discussed . on the technical side , it is important to mention that the ( sub)mm is currently the shortest wavelength where sensitive , many - elements coherent detection interferometers are feasible from the ground . these can simultaneously provide high angular resolution , sensitivity , and image reconstruction fidelity . direct detection interferometers at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. mid / near - ir ) can achieve similar angular resolution , but are more severely constrained in terms of sensitivity and image fidelity . m ( _ right _ ) . note that most of the far - ir emission comes from a region that is heavily obscured at optical wavelengths . credit of the space telescope science institute ( optical hst image ) and of c. dowell ( submm cso image ) . ] the warm dust emitting at far ir wavelengths is mostly heated by the uv radiation field of young massive stars in star forming regions . as a consequence , the far infrared luminosity @xmath5 and its submm rayleigh - jeans part are considered good tracers of star formation in galaxies . in particular , these bands are useful to trace obscured star formation , since they are virtually unaffected by dust extinction . this is evident in fig . [ fig_antennae ] , where the 350@xmath1 m map of the interacting galaxies `` antennae '' ( obtained at the cso telescope , c. dowell , priv . is compared with the optical hst 20@xmath6 ) . both these issues will no longer be a problem with alma , which will have sensitivities orders of magnitude better and an angular resolution similar to hst . as already mentioned , also most of the _ gas _ phase of the cold ism emits in the mm - submm range . more specifically , it is in this band that most of the molecular gas transitions are observed . however , _ cold _ molecular hydrogen h@xmath7 ( by far the most abundant molecule in the cold gas phase ) can not be detected directly , since it has no electric dipole moment ( therefore rotational transitions with @xmath8 are not allowed ) . carbon monoxide co is the second most abundant molecule : its rotational levels are excited by collisions with h@xmath7 , producing the brightest molecular lines in the spectrum of any galaxy . the luminosity of the co rotational transitions , and in particular the fundamental one j(1@xmath90 ) , are widely used as tracers of the molecular gas mass through a linear relation : @xmath10 . however , the conversion factor @xmath11 is found to depend on the gas metallicity as well as on its physical conditions ( temperature and density ) . the critical density of the co transitions is relatively low , at least for the low rotational levels . for instance , the critical density of co ( 10 ) ( at 115 ghz ) is about @xmath12 . as a consequence , co is generally little effective in tracing the high density regions of molecular clouds . moreover , the large optical thickness the co lines ( at least for the low rational levels ) prevents us to penetrate dense molecular regions . dense regions are better traced by other species , such as hcn , hco@xmath13 and cs , which are characterized by higher critical densities for transitions in the same frequency bands as the co ones . for instance hcn ( 10 ) , hco@xmath13 ( 10 ) and cs ( 21 ) ( observable in the 3 mm band ) , have critical densities of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . however , these lines are typically one order of magnitude fainter than co. , indicated by the solid line . the right - hand axis translates the far - ir luminosity into star formation rate . _ right : _ @xmath17 as a function of the far ir luminosity . the right - hand axis gives the gas exhaustion timescale , where @xmath11 is the @xmath18to h@xmath7 conversion factor ( @xmath19 ) . both figures are from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] , indicated by the solid line . the right - hand axis translates the far - ir luminosity into star formation rate . _ right : _ @xmath17 as a function of the far ir luminosity . the right - hand axis gives the gas exhaustion timescale , where @xmath11 is the @xmath18to h@xmath7 conversion factor ( @xmath19 ) . both figures are from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] there is a relationship between infrared luminosity and co luminosity , which is by itself not surprising ( as most luminosity - luminosity relations ) . more interesting is the fact that the relation is not linear , being @xmath20 ( fig . [ fig_fir_co ] , from @xcite ) . since @xmath5 is proportional to the star formation rate sfr , while @xmath21 is proportional to the molecular gas content m(h@xmath7 ) ( which is the fuel for star formation ) , the non linear relation implies that the star formation efficiency , defined as @xmath22 increases with the luminosity of the system . the inverse of the star formation efficiency is the gas exhaustion timescale , @xmath23 , i.e. the time required by the starburst to totally consume the available molecular gas , if the star formation proceeds at the rate currently observed . the non linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath21 implies that the gas exhaustion timescale decreases with luminosity , reaching values as low as @xmath24 , as illustrated in fig . [ fig_fir_co ] . it is clear that the most powerful starbursts are also short lived . however , it should be mentioned that this picture may be biased , especially for what concerns high redshift sources , due to the incomplete census of galaxy populations . indeed , @xcite have recently identified some _ powerful _ starburst galaxies characterized by _ low _ sfe at z@xmath02 . the far - ir luminosity appears to be _ linearly _ correlated with the luminosity of dense gas tracers , such as hcn . the relation is linear over a very broad luminosity range spanning from galactic star forming regions to powerful starburst galaxies @xcite . this result suggests that star formation always occurs in dense molecular clouds , and that star formation in starburst systems may simply be a scaled up version of galactic star formation . however , also the linearity between @xmath5 and @xmath25 has been recently questioned through indications that the ratio between these two quantities increases with the luminosity @xcite . moreover , the presence of an agn may also affect the intensity of the hcn emission , as discussed in [ sec_past_agn_local ] . interferometers allowed astronomers to map the molecular gas in large samples of galaxies , generally by exploiting the co lines , but more recently also through transitions of various other species . the co emission in galaxies show a variety of morphologies : spiral patterns , bars , rings , nuclear concentrations and irregular distributions @xcite . the co maps also reveal important kinematic information . in the case of disk or ring - like morphologies the gas kinematics is generally dominated by ( nearly ) regular rotation . in the case of barred galaxies , the molecular gas kinematics is often characterized by prominent streaming motions along the stellar bar ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this is regarded as direct evidence that the non - axisymmetric potential of a bar is effective in funneling gas into the central region ( which may eventually produce a central starburst , or be further driven into the nuclear region to fuel an agn ) . agns generally heat their circumnuclear dust to temperatures much higher than starburst galaxies . indeed , active nuclei are generally characterized by strong mid - ir and near - ir emission , indicating dust temperatures of several hundred degrees and reaching the dust sublimation temperature ( 15002000 k ) . at far - ir and submillimeter wavelengths the relative contribution of agn and star formation to the dust heating is debated . spectral decomposition techniques , as well as the correlation between far - ir emission and other tracers of star formation , suggest that the far - ir and submm emission is dominated by star formation in the host galaxies , even in powerful qsos @xcite . disentangling _ spatially _ the far - ir / submm emission due to the agn from the host galaxy emission is very difficult , if not impossible , with current facilities due to the lack of angular resolution at these wavelengths . disentangling the two components is important not only to determine the contribution of agns to the far - ir / submm radiation , but also to constrain models of the obscuring dusty torus , as we shall see in [ sec_alma_local ] . identifying the main mechanism responsible for fuelling agns has been one of the hottest topics in the last decade . non - axisymmetric potentials introduced by stellar bars and galaxy interactions were considered as promising mechanisms , but various studies failed in finding any excess of these morphologies in agns . co observations offer the possibility of directly witnessing the gas fuelling towards the nucleus . intensive campaigns have been performed with millimetric interferometers to investigate this issue by mapping the co emission in galaxies with different types of nuclear activity ( e.g. the nuga project , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the main result is that there is no evidence for systematic differences , in terms of molecular gas distribution and kinematics , between galaxies hosting agns and quiescent ones . in particular , seyfert galaxies appear characterized by a wide variety of molecular gas distributions : streaming motions along stellar bars , rings , nuclear concentrations , nuclear voids and irregular distributions . the lack of any relationship between the presence of an agn and the co morphology / dynamics , indicates that there is no ubiquitous evidence for current fuelling of the agn . one possibility , is that the large scale fuelling phase and the agn phase may not be simultaneous . another consideration is that local agns have low luminosities and do not require large fuelling rates from the host galaxies . more specifically , most local seyfert nuclei are characterized by black hole accretion rates of about @xmath26 ; at these rates even a single molecular cloud of @xmath27 can keep the nucleus active for about 1 gyr . the fuelling problem is more serious for powerful qsos , where the accretion rates may exceed @xmath28 . in qsos some mechanism capable of funneling molecular gas from the host galaxy into the nuclear region is actually required . however , qsos are much more distant than seyfert galaxies . the limited sensitivity and angular resolution of current mm interferometers hampers our capability of mapping the molecular gas distribution in qso hosts , which will instead be easy with alma . ngc 1068 is one of the best studied agns also at mm - submm wavelengths . at the highest resolution currently achievable the nuclear co distribution shows a broken ring - like structure , about 2@xmath6 in size ( corresponding to 140 pc ) , as illustrated in fig . [ fig_n1068 ] @xcite . at the specific location of the agn ( cross in fig . [ fig_n1068 ] ) little co emission is observed . does this mean that little or no molecular gas is present in the vicinity of the agn ? this is somewhat contrary to expectations , given the need of gas in the vicinity of the agn both to feed it and to provide the heavy obscuration characterizing ngc 1068 @xcite . actually , we know that in the vicinity of the agn , on scales of 110 pc , dense molecular gas and dust are present , based on radio and mid - ir interferometric observations @xcite . possibly most of the molecular gas in the nuclear region is dense and warm , and therefore not properly sampled by the co lines ( at least not by the low rotational transitions ) . maps of other lines tracing dense gas , such as hcn , have lower angular resolution @xcite , but do show a much higher concentration on the nucleus with respect to co. @xcite detected several molecular species in the nucleus of ngc 1068 tracing not only dense gas , but also a very complex chemistry . these findings indicate that the agn has created a giant `` x - ray dominated region '' ( xdr ) . hard x - ray photons emitted by the agn can penetrate deep into the circumnuclear molecular clouds and keep the temperature high over an extended region . the high gas temperature in xdr s favors the formation of various molecular species such as hcn @xcite . in contrast , photo dissociation regions ( pdr ) , which are generated by the uv photons of star forming regions , are characterized by a much narrower region with enhanced temperature , making the production of various molecular species much less efficient than in xdr . these fundamental differences between xdr s and pdr s suggest that xdr - enhanced species can be used to unveil the presence of heavily obscured agns that escaped detection at other wavelengths . within this context @xcite and @xcite developed a diagnostic diagram involving the line ratios hcn / hco@xmath13 versus hcn / co , where pure seyfert nuclei are clearly separated from starburst nuclei , in the sense that the former show enhanced hcn emission ( but see also caveats discussed in * ? ? ? * ) . this and other complementary diagnostic diagrams will be usable with alma to identify obscured agns even in distant galaxies . ( scaled from the sed of m82 ) at different redshifts ( z@xmath292 , 5 , 7 and 10 , as labelled ) . note that the observed flux at @xmath30 changes very little . the thick blue and red lines show the alma and jwst sensitivities for continuum detection at 5@xmath31 with an integration of @xmath32 . ] as the spectrum of a starburst galaxy moves in redshift , the global flux is reduced according to the 1/d@xmath33 cosmological dimming , but the intrinsic luminosity observed at a fixed mm - submm wavelength increases as a consequence of the steeply rising submm continuum . at z@xmath41 such strong negative k correction counteracts completely the cosmological dimming , so that detecting a source at z@xmath2910 is as easy as detecting a source at z@xmath291 ( for a given intrinsic luminosity ) . this effect is illustrated in fig . [ fig_sed_z ] , which shows the observed flux distribution of a star forming galaxy at different redshifts . the flux observed at @xmath34 mm is essentially unchanged within the redshift range @xmath35 . [ fig_kneg ] shows the same effect by plotting , for a given starburst template , the observed flux at various wavelengths ( and specifically in the alma bands ) as a function of redshift . the observed flux remains nearly constant in the redshift range 1@xmath36z@xmath3610 at wavelengths longer than about 800@xmath1 m . at wavelengths shorter than @xmath0500@xmath1 correction is not strong enough to compensate for the cosmological dimming . at wavelengths longer than @xmath02 mm the k - correction is strong , but the observed flux is more than one order of magnitude fainter than observed at 1 mm ; moreover , at @xmath37 there is an increasing `` risk '' of contamination by non - thermal sources . ( by scaling the m82 template ) observed in the different mm - submm alma bands . note the nearly flat trend at 1@xmath36z@xmath3610 at wavelengths close to @xmath01 mm . the predicted flux density in the optical ( @xmath38 ) is also shown for comparison . ] an interesting consequence of the strongly negative k correction at mm - submm wavelengths is that in any deep field one expects to see many more galaxies at z@xmath41.5 than at lower redshifts . this is just the opposite of what observed in the optical , where the distribution of observed fluxes is dominated by the cosmological dimming ( fig . [ fig_kneg ] ) , which makes any optical deep field dominated by galaxies at z@xmath361.5 , and only a small fraction of galaxies at higher redshifts . the negative k correction allowed the discovery of a large number ( a few 100 ) of starburst galaxies at high - z , thanks to extensive surveys exploiting array of bolometers available on single dish telescopes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for a review ) . dusty starburst galaxies at high - z discovered through the detection of their submm continuum are often dubbed as sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) . although , high - z dusty starbursts have been also discovered through observations in the mm band , for sake of simplicity we will refer to the whole population as `` smgs '' . much effort has been invested for several years in the identification of the optical ( or near - ir ) counterparts of smgs , mostly with the goal of determining their redshift through spectroscopic followup . however , as we will discuss in [ sec_current_facilities ] , the angular resolution of single dish telescopes is so low ( 11@xmath618@xmath6 ) that several optical / near - ir candidate counterparts are found within the telescope beam . the optimal way to identify the true counterpart would be to obtain mm - submm observations at higher angular resolution with a mm - submm interferometer . however , as discussed in [ sec_current_facilities ] , the sensitivity to continuum of current mm - submm interferometers is low , making this approach very expensive in terms of observing time , especially if a statistically meaningful sample is needed . @xcite employed the alternative strategy of exploiting deep radio vla observations . given the tight correlation between far - ir thermal emission and radio synchrotron emission observed in galaxies , most smgs should be associated with a detectable radio source . the higher angular resolution achievable with the vla allowed @xcite to locate the position of the smgs with an accuracy high enough to position the slit for the spectroscopic identification . note also that the large vla primary beam , resulting into a large field of view , allowed the simultaneous radio detection of many smgs in each single pointing . the identification of a prominent ly@xmath11 in many of the deep spectra provided the redshift for several tens smgs . the smgs redshift distribution resulting from these surveys is shown in fig . [ fig_smg_z ] ( left ) , and it is characterized by a median redshift @xmath39 . the redshift distribution is very similar to that of qsos , suggesting a link between the two populations of objects . the sample of smgs for which a redshift has been measured is limited to a submm flux of a few mjy . the inferred redshifts imply far - ir luminosities of several times @xmath40 , i.e. extreme ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( more luminous , on average , than local ulirg samples ) . therefore , currently identified smgs represent only the most luminous population of high - z dusty starbursts ( the tip of the iceberg ) . in fig . [ fig_smg_z ] ( right ) the inferred contribution of smgs to the density of star formation ( sfrd ) is compared with those inferred by uv / optical surveys and radio / ir tracers @xcite . smgs are indicated with large squares , while small squares show an attempt to account for the incompleteness due to the fact that current surveys only sample the most luminous sources , as discussed above . clearly , once incompleteness is accounted for , smg contribute significantly to the history of star formation , especially at redshifts around two . again , their evolution appears very similar to that of qsos , suggesting a close link between smgs and the evolution of massive halos which hosts qsos . the redshift determination of smgs allowed also their millimetric spectroscopic followup with interferometers aimed at the detection of molecular transitions ( which requires an accurate knowledge of the redshift due to the limited bandwidth ) . intensive campaigns , especially with the iram pdb interferometer yielded the detection of co rotational transitions for several smgs @xcite , indicating that these galaxies also host huge amounts of molecular gas . the profile of the co lines is often double - peaked , indicative of a rotating disk or of a merging of two galaxies . followup interferometric observations at higher angular resolution have found that both the continuum and line emission are very compact in most smgs , a few kpc or even less @xcite . the compactness of the smgs provides constraints on the inferred central densities , which result much higher than in any other population of starburst galaxies , but comparable to those of compact passive galaxies found in the same redshift range . these findings , along with the huge inferred star formation rates , suggest that smgs are progenitors of local massive ellipticals , experiencing their main episode of star formation , but which must undergo further structural evolution in order to reach the sizes observed in local ellipticals . these interferometric data also provide constraints on the global dynamical mass , typically yielding masses of a few times @xmath41 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? interestingly , the inferred high density of massive galaxies ( @xmath42 ) at z@xmath02 is difficult to reconcile with classical hierarchical models of galaxy evolution . millimetric and submillimetric observations of distant agns are currently limited mostly to powerful qsos ( although we will later discuss the case of lower luminosity agns discovered in smgs ) . bolometric observations of large qso samples have detected mm - submm continuum emission at the level of a few mjy in about 60 optically selected qsos and about 20 radio galaxies at z@xmath41 , out to z=6.4 @xcite . generally the detection [隐藏] achieved with current facilities is about 30% among bright qsos . detected qsos have far - ir luminosities of about @xmath43 , but these clearly represent the tip of the iceberg due to our current sensitivity limits . m luminosity ( which is a tracer of star formation ) and far - ir luminosity ( inferred from the mm / submm emission in high - z qsos ) . high - z mm - bright qsos follow the same relation of local starburst ulirgs , indicating that the far - ir emission of the former is mostly due to star formation ( from * ? ? ? ] for a fraction of high - z qso the inferred far - ir luminosity follows the same correlation with the radio luminosity as local star forming galaxies , suggesting that the far - ir luminosity is powered mostly by star formation @xcite . this result is supported by the spitzer mid - ir detection , in a number of mm - bright qsos , of strong pah emissionm . these species are mostly destroyed in the strong radiation field produced by agns . ] , which is considered a good tracer of star formation @xcite . moreover , the pah luminosity is found to correlate with the far - ir luminosity and following the same relation of starburst galaxies ( fig.[fig_pah ] ) , further supporting the starburst origin of the far - ir emission . the star formation rates inferred from the far - ir luminosity ( as well as from the pah luminosity ) are as high as a few times @xmath44 . this suggests that in mm - bright qso we are witnessing the simultaneous growth of black holes ( as traced by the optical and x - ray agn emission ) and of the stellar mass in their host galaxy ( as traced by the far - ir ) , which will probably evolve into massive ellipticals @xcite . such a co - coeval growth is expected in models of bh - galaxy evolution aimed at explaining the local relation between spheroids and bh mass @xcite . however , the relation between star formation and black hole accretion ( i.e. the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath45 ) seems to saturate at high luminosities @xcite , suggesting that at high - z the bh growth proceeds more rapidly than the host growth . ) already present in this object close to the epoch of re - ionization . adapted from @xcite . ] the high far - ir luminosities inferred from the mm - submm observations also imply large amount of dust in the host of high - z qsos . accurate measurements of the dust mass are however difficult to obtain due to the unknown dust temperature and emissivity . multiple band observations greatly help to remove the degeneracy between these quantities @xcite . fig.[fig_j1148_dust ] shows the rest - frame infrared sed of one of the most distant qsos ( z=6.4 ) known so far , for which the far - ir thermal bump is relatively well sampled thanks to various submm and mm observations . the inferred dust masses are as high as several times @xmath46 . the discovery of such huge masses of dust in the most distant qsos is puzzling . indeed , in the local universe the main source of dust are the atmospheres of evolved stars ( mostly agb ) . however , at z@xmath46 the age of the universe is less than 1 gyr , which is the minimum time required for agb stars to evolve in large numbers and to significantly enrich the ism with dust . this suggests that in the early universe other mechanisms dominate the dust production . core - collapse sne are candidate sources of dust on short timescales . observations have indeed found dust formed in sn ejecta @xcite , as also expected on theoretical grounds @xcite . the extinction curve inferred in high - z qsos and galaxies appears in agreement with that expected for dust produced in sn ejecta @xcite , supporting the idea that sne may indeed be the major source of dust in the early universe . however , even with the highest dust yield observed so far , the huge mass of dust inferred from mm - submm observations of the most distant qsos remains difficult to account for @xcite . extensive reviews on the co emission in high - z objects , and in agns in particular , are given in @xcite and in @xcite . more than half of the @xmath040 co detections obtained at high redshift ( z@xmath41 ) are in agns ( qsos or radio galaxies ) . in particular , all of the detections at z@xmath43.5 are in agns . the higher detection rate in high - z qsos is mostly due to their huge far - ir luminosities and to the co - fir correlation ( [ sec_past_normal_local ] ) . the molecular gas masses inferred from the co detections are of the order of a few times @xmath47 . except for the huge amounts of molecular gas , the general properties of the co emission in high - z qsos and radio - galaxies do not differ strongly from local and lower redshift powerful starbursts . the observation of multiple co transitions suggests that the co excitation temperature is higher in some qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but the statistics are still very low . the co emission follows the same trend with the fir luminosity observed in fig . [ fig_fir_co ] , indicating that qso host galaxies are experiencing a strong starburst event in the process of rapidly exhausting the available molecular gas , on a time scale of only @xmath48 . it is interesting to note that the relation between co luminosity ( tracing the amount of molecular gas ) and optical luminosity ( tracing the black hole accretion rate in qsos ) is not linear , as shown in fig . [ fig_co_opt ] @xcite . this result indicates that , while the black hole can accrete at very high rates ( limited only by its eddington luminosity ) , the host galaxy has only a limited amount of molecular gas available for star formation ( given by the galaxy evolutionary mechanism ) ; hence the two formation processes probably occur on different time scales ( as already discussed above ) . deep observations have allowed the detection of transitions from other molecular and atomic species , such as hcn , hco@xmath13 , hnc , cn an ci , which are tracers of high density gas and of the gas chemistry and excitation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? however , these detections are limited to very few bright sources , due to the limited sensitivity of current facilities . within the limited statistics available , the intensity of these lines relative to co and to @xmath5 do not differ strongly from lower redshift and local starburst galaxies ( although there are indications that the intensity of hcn decreases at high luminosities ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? 158@xmath1 m fine structure line in one of the most distant quasars known , j1148 + 5152 , at z=6.4 @xcite . _ lower panel : _ the co(65 ) transition observed in the same objects is shown for comparison @xcite . note the different flux scales on the two panels . ] recently , deep observations achieved the first detection of the [ cii ] fine structure line at 158@xmath1 m in two high - z qsos ( fig . [ fig_cii ] ) @xcite . this line is emitted by photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) in star forming galaxies , and it is the strongest line in the spectrum of nearly any galaxy . the ratio @xmath49}/l_{fir}$ ] observed in these two high - z qsos is about @xmath50 , i.e. similar to the value observed in local ulirgs . the detection of [ cii ] with a luminosity relative to @xmath5 similar to local sources suggests that these high - z systems have already been enriched with heavy elements , and with carbon in particular @xcite . generally the angular resolution and sensitivity are not good enough to trace co rotational curves and therefore to obtain accurate constraints on the dynamical mass . however , in some high - z bright agn the kinematics is resolved , especially in lensed cases , where the lensing shear helps to resolve the galaxy structures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? in other unresolved , or marginally resolved qsos the width of the co line , along with measurements ( or limits ) on the size of the co emitting region provide some constraints on the dynamical mass ( e.g * ? ? ? typical dynamical masses inferred for qso hosts and radio galaxies are of the order of a few times @xmath41 . however , we should recall that current observations sample only the `` tip of the iceberg '' of the agn population at high redshift . recently , @xcite attempted to calibrate the width of co lines in galaxies as a proxy of their dynamical masses . once this calibration is applied to the host of qsos , the resulting galaxy mass can be compared with the black hole mass inferred from their optical - uv emission lines . an interesting result is that high - z qsos appear to deviate from the local bh - galaxy mass relation , in the sense that their hosts are less massive than expected . this result is in agreement with other independent indications that the bh - galaxy mass relation evolves at high redshift @xcite . however , one should be careful when using the co line width as a tracer of the dynamical mass in ( unobscured ) qsos . indeed , selection effects make qsos hosts to be viewed preferentially face - on , since edge - on views tend to be obscured . as a consequence , the observed width of the co line in qsos is likely reduced due to projection effects @xcite , and may not be representative of the intrinsic rotation of the co disk @xcite . corresponds to about 800 pc . ] an interesting particular result is the co(32 ) map of one of the most distant qsos , j1148 + 5152 , at z=6.4 ( fig . [ fig_j1148_map ] ) @xcite . the map shows resolved emission extending over about 5 kpc and two central peaks separated by 1.7 kpc . from the velocity structure @xcite infer a dynamical mass of about @xmath51 . this mass is much lower than the mass of a few times @xmath52 that would be expected from the black hole mass derived for the same object ( a few times @xmath53 ) if applying the local bh - bulge mass relation . this result would provide further support to the scenario where at high - z black holes grow faster then their host galaxies , while the latter reach the local bh - bulge relation only at lower redshifts . however , observations at higher angular resolution and with higher sensitivity are certainly required to better determine the dynamical mass , and remove the degeneracy with the inclination angle of the putative disk . above we have discussed mm - submm observations aimed at specifically investigating objects known to host powerful agns ( qsos or radio - galaxies ) . we can however consider the orthogonal approach : do galaxies discovered at mm - submm wavelengths ( smgs ) host agns ? this issue has been investigated with the aid of deep x - ray observations . @xcite found that most smgs do host a x - ray source whose luminosity and spectral shape can only be ascribed to the presence of an obscured agn . however , even when corrected for absorption , the inferred agn luminosity can not account for far - ir luminosity observed in smgs , hence the main source of far - ir emission in smgs is due to star formation . similar results were obtained more recently thanks to spitzer mid - ir spectroscopy @xcite . the detection of strong pahs in the spectra of most smgs supports the scenario where most of the luminosity is due to star formation . the detection of a weak mid - ir continuum due to hot dust does trace the presence of an obscured agn in some smgs , but with a bolometric power much lower than the starburst component . summarizing , smgs represent a critical phase in the formation of massive galaxies ; black hole accretion is accompanying this major star formation event , but at a rate much lower than observed in qsos . millimetric and submillimetric facilities can be divided in two main classes : single dish telescopes and interferometers . these two classes of facilities are often complementary , especially in extragalactic astronomy , one generally being characterized by wider field of view and higher sensitivity to continuum , the other providing higher angular resolution and higher sensitivity for line detection . this section provides a short overview of the current facilities in both classes , by also discussing their main relative advantages and limitations . a list of the main currently available single dish mm - submm telescopes is given in tab . [ tab_sing_dish ] . current single dish telescopes have a diffraction limited angular resolution of only about 1020@xmath6 . however , one of the main advantages of single dish telescopes relative to interferometers is their wide field of view , which makes single dish telescopes optimally suited for wide area surveys . all single dish telescopes are equipped with various heterodyne receivers for spectroscopy . however , an additional advantage of single dish telescopes is the possibility of using bolometers , which ( thanks to their wider band width ) are more sensitive to the continuum emission than heterodyne receivers . to fully exploit the large field of view for the detection of mm - submm sources , observatories have developed cameras hosting large bolometer arrays that allow the simultaneous observation of wide areas of the sky . [ tab_sing_dish ] lists the main bolometer cameras currently available , with a short summary of their characteristics ( number of detectors , wavelength of operation , field of view ) . most of the high redshift submillimeter galaxies known so far have been discovered thanks to such bolometer arrays . some of these single dish observatories are dedicating an increasing fraction of their total observing time to extensive surveys by exploiting these bolometer cameras . probably this will be one of the main working modes for some single dish telescopes when alma will be in operation : single dish telescopes will provide continuum targets through wide area surveys to be then observed in depth with alma ( to obtain spectroscopic information , multi - band data , and angular resolution information ) . .main mm - submm single dish telescopes currently available [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ] + notes : + @xmath54 angular resolution in arcsec in the compact ( 200 m ) and in the most extended configuration ( 18 km ) . + @xmath55 field of view in arcsec estimated as the full width half maximum of the primary beam . + @xmath56 continuum sensitivity : rms ( in mjy ) in one minute of integration , derived by using the eso etc . the weather conditions were automatically selected by the etc depending on the band . + @xmath57 emission line sensitivity : rms ( in mjy ) in one minute of integration , derived by using the eso etc and by assuming a line width of 300 km / s . + @xmath58 initially only 6 antennas will be equipped with band 5 ( which explains the much lower sensitivity in this band ) . + @xmath59 funding of band 10 is still pending , awaiting results from the technical development . the sensitivity and frequency range quoted for this band are just indicative , and may be subject to significant variations depending on technical constraints . alma consists of at least 54@xmath6012 m antennas and 12@xmath607 m antennas for a total collecting area of at least 6500 m@xmath33 . the antenna configurations will cover baselines ranging from 200 m out to 18 km , yielding a maximum angular resolution better than 0.1@xmath6 at 3 mm , and better than 0.01@xmath6 at submm wavelengths ( tab . [ tab_alma ] ) . the field of view is limited by the primary beam of individual antennas and it ranges from 1@xmath61 at 3 mm to about 10@xmath6 at submm wavelengths ( tab . [ tab_alma ] ) . [ fig_alma_art ] shows an artistic view of the alma array in extended and compact configurations . the 7 m antennas and 4 of the 12 m antennas are clustered into the atacama compact array , aca ( fig . [ fig_alma_art ] ) , which will have a compact fixed configuration aimed at covering the _ uv _ plane on short spacings . aca will be crucial to recover diffuse emission extending on scales larger than a few arcsec ( which is resolved out by the alma array ) . for more than 50% of the time , allowing very sensitive observations at submm wavelengths . courtesy of the european southern observatory . ] alma will be located on chajnantor plateau , in the atacama desert ( chile ) , at an altitude of 5000 m. this is an exceptionally dry site providing a good transparency even in the 350@xmath1 m and 450@xmath1 m windows for a significant fraction of the time . in particular , the precipitable water vapor ( the main source of opacity ) is @xmath62 for more than 50% of the time , at least during the winter months ( fig . [ fig_pwv ] ) . the vast flat topography of chajnantor plateau is optimal to accommodate the various array configurations , providing some constraints on the location of the antennas only in the most extended configuration . the antennas will be moved from one station to the other by means of huge trucks at a rate of 2 antennas / day . as listed in tab . [ tab_alma ] , receivers for 6 frequency bands are currently fully funded ( bands 3 , 4 and 69 ) . band 5 ( 163211 ghz ) is currently planned only for 6 antennas . the funding and the specifications of band 10 are pending , since the receivers development is still in progress . the distribution of the alma bands relative to the atmospheric windows is illustrated in fig . [ fig_atm_transmission ] . the maximum simultaneous frequency coverage allowed by the huge correlator is 8 ghz , which allows alma to reach high sensitivities even for the continuum detection [ tab_alma ] summarizes the alma sensitivities ( both for continuum and line detection ) . for instance , in band 7 ( 870@xmath1 m ) alma reaches the extraordinary sensitivity of @xmath00.1 mjy ( rms ) in one minute of integration , to be compared with the scuba sensitivity of about 1 mjy ( rms ) in 1 hour of integration . constructions at the alma site started already a few years ago and are now nearly completed . at the time of writing the first eight antennas have arrived for integration and testing at the operations support facilities ( osf , located at about 30 km from the alma site ) . in early 2009 the first three antennas will be moved to the alma operations site ( aos ) for commissioning . in 2010 a call for proposal is planned for early science with an initial set of at least 16 antennas . the full array is scheduled to come in full operation in 2012 . an important feature of the alma organization is the plan of making it an observing facility easily accessible also by non - experts in the field . both the software to prepare the observations and the pipeline for the data reduction are designed to be easy to use also by people that are not necessarily experts in interferometry nor necessarily acquainted with mm / submm observing techniques . this is an important characteristic that will make alma totally open to a broad astronomical community . it is obvious that the alma capabilities will allow astronomers to tackle numerous outstanding issues , spanning most of the research fields in astronomy . a summary of some of the main scientific goals can be found in the design reference science plan ( drsp ) , available at http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/alma/drsp11.shtml . it is beyond the scope of these lecture notes to provide an overview of the several outstanding scientific cases for alma . in this section i will only focus on some of the alma prospects for agn studies and some related topics , but even in this field the discussion is not meant to be exhaustive . one of the most hotly debated issues on agns is the physics , structure and dynamics of the circumnuclear molecular medium , which is both responsible for the obscuration of agns and presumably related to their feeding . some models assume a uniform gas distribution in a toroidal geometry , whose thickness is supported by ir radiation pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ? other models propose that the circumnuclear obscuring medium is clumpy and originated by the outflow of the accretion disk @xcite . yet other models assume a clumpy distribution due to the effects of supernova explosions or stellar winds , which are also responsible for making the medium `` thick '' @xcite . the high angular resolution , along with its spectroscopic capabilities , will allow alma to clearly distinguish between these models , both through morphological analyses and by investigating the kinematics of the nuclear and circumnuclear medium . [ fig_wada ] shows the expected distribution of circumnuclear co emission according to the torus model in @xcite , and convolved with the angular resolution of alma projected at the distance of ngc 1068 ( panel _ c _ ) : the clumpy nature of the `` torus '' is clearly resolved . actually , the structure shown in fig . [ fig_wada ] describes the extended component of the torus ( radius @xmath032 pc ) , which contains a large amount of gas , but accounts only for a small fraction of the nuclear obscuration . most of the obscuration is due to dense gas on the parsec scale @xcite , as also inferred by mid - ir interferometric observations @xcite . in clumpy models the dust within each individual cloud spans a wide range of temperatures and therefore emits strongly at all wavelengths , from mid - ir to submm . as a consequence , an interesting prediction of clumpy models is that the nuclear `` torus '' , made of out of several clouds , should show the same morphology at all infrared wavelengths . in contrast , uniform `` torus '' models expect a strong radial temperature gradient and , therefore , the innermost warm dust should emit much more at mid - ir wavelengths , while submm radiation from cold dust should be observed mostly in the outer regions . at high frequencies alma has an angular resolution matching vlti ( i.e. sub - pc scale at the distance of famous agns such as ngc 1068 and circinus ) , therefore it will be possible to directly compare the mid - ir morphology with the submm morphology and directly test the predictions of clumpy and uniform torus models . the gas kinematics inferred from alma observations of the nuclear molecular emission lines will provide important information on the dynamical stability and origin of the circumnuclear medium . in the case of a simple uniform structure , supported by radiation pressure , we expect gas motions to be dominated mostly by rotation . in the case of a medium originated by the accretion disk wind @xcite we expect the molecular gas kinematics to also show a clear outflow component . in the case of a strong contribution by sn and stellar winds we also expect a strong turbulent component , hence a large width of the emission lines even within resolved regions . obviously investigating the molecular gas in the innermost regions will require the observation of species typically tracing dense and highly excited gas ( e.g. hcn , hco@xmath13 , ... ) , which are much fainter than co , but easy to detect with alma . a detailed modelling of the excitation and emissivity distribution of these high density tracers in agn torii has been recently performed by @xcite . according to these models the flux ratios between these molecular lines is expected to be spatially highly inhomogeneous , reflecting the inhomogeneous structure of the molecular torus . only the excellent angular resolution of alma will allow us to reveal such complex structures for the first time . the horizontal blue dashed lines indicate the angular resolution at @xmath63 of various current or planned optical / near - ir facilities ( jwst , 8 m telescope , 30 m telescope , vlti ) . the red shaded area gives the range of angular resolution achievable with alma at different frequencies . courtesy of a. marconi . ] by resolving the molecular gas dynamics on such small scales it will be possible to measure the mass of the nuclear black hole . for instance , in ngc 1068 the @xmath64 black hole has a sphere of influence with a radius of about 4 pc , requiring a beam projected on the sky smaller than 0.05@xmath6 to be resolved , which is achievable with alma at most frequencies . in ngc 1068 , and a few additional nearby sy2s , the bh mass has been already measured thanks to vlbi observations of a maser h@xmath7o disk @xcite ; however , the latter technique can only be exploited in a few cases where the maser disk is observed nearly edge - on ( within 15@xmath65 of the line of sight ) . alma observations of the nuclear molecular gas will allow us to extend the measurement of black hole masses in agns to large samples , without stringent constraints on the geometry of the nuclear gas distribution . [ fig_bh_rinf ] shows the radius of influence , as projected on the sky , of black holes of different masses in the nuclei of galaxies , as a function of their distance ( the central stellar gravitational potential is assumed to match the @xmath66 relation ) . the red shaded area indicates the range of angular resolution achievable with alma at various frequencies . clearly alma is in principle able to measure even very small black holes ( @xmath67 ) in nearby systems ( @xmath68 ) ; therefore alma will allow us to extend the investigation of the @xmath66 relation to very low masses . alma will also allow us to measure massive black holes ( @xmath69 ) in distant systems , @xmath70 ; at these distances we can find the closest cases of merging systems ( most of which are powerful ulirgs ) . in these cases alma will measure the black hole mass within each of the two merging systems , which will allow us to place the two individual black holes on the @xmath66 relation and to compare their location with the evolutionary path expected by models of hierarchical black hole growth ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * e.g. ) . at mm - submm wavelengths with the angular resolution achievable with a mm - submm vlbi . the left panels illustrate the result of the model , showing a clear `` shadow '' due to the light bending by the gravitational field of the supermassive black hole . the other panels show the image obtained after convolution with the beam expected for the mm - submm vlbi . the panels on the top are for a rotating black hole , while the panels on the bottom are for a non - rotating black hole . from @xcite . ] alma will also be a powerful machine to discover heavily obscured agns . it is now clear that a population of obscured agn are missed by optical spectroscopic surveys aimed at identifying agns through their characteristic narrow emission lines @xcite . some of these obscured agns are missed because the narrow line region is also obscured by dust in the host galaxy @xcite . in other cases the nlr is not formed at all ( as inferred by the lack of nlr lines even in the mid - ir , * ? ? ? * ) , probably because the ionizing radiation is absorbed in all directions ( i.e. 4@xmath71 obscuration rather than a torus - like geometry ) . however , the x - rays emitted by the agns create extended xdrs , which are characterized by enhanced temperatures favoring the formation of several molecular species characteristics of these regions , as discussed in [ sec_past_normal_local ] . the molecular transitions and diagnostics typical of these regions ( e.g. enhanced hcn / hco@xmath13 * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) do not suffer any dust absorption and will be easily detected with alma even in distant systems . therefore , alma will be able to provide an unbiased census of the agn population , by including also those heavily obscured agns that are not detectable at other wavelengths . i conclude this section by discussing the potentialities for the investigation of our galactic center . the nuclear radio source sgra@xmath72 is also a mm / submm source . if the emitting region is uniformly distributed around the supermassive black hole , then @xcite showed that photons are expected to be deviated by the strong gravitational field within a few schwarzschild radii , therefore creating a `` shadow '' in a putative mm / submm high resolution image ( fig . [ fig_falcke ] , left ) . there is a plan of combining alma with other mm / submm observatories distributed world wide to create ( sub-)millimetric vlbi network , reaching an angular resolution of a few 10@xmath1arcsec , which would allow us to resolve the black hole `` shadow '' ( fig . [ fig_falcke ] , right ) . this would really be a major result , essentially the first `` picture '' of a black hole . the shape and the contrast of the `` shadow '' would also allow us to determine whether the black hole is rotating ( upper panels in fig . [ fig_falcke ] ) or not ( lower panels ) . we have seen in [ sec_past_starburst_highz ] that current mm / submm observations of high - z objects are limited to very luminous systems ( @xmath43 ) , not representative of the bulk of the galaxy population at high redshift . alma will be able to detect galaxies at least two orders of magnitude fainter , therefore providing an unbiased view of the evolution of galaxies from the mm / submm perspective . [ fig_sed_z ] , compares the continuum sensitivity of alma ( 24 hours of integration ) with the continuum flux expected by a galaxy with @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath74 ) at various redshifts . it is clear that with the same integration time alma will be able to detect the thermal dust continuum of galaxies that are three times fainter . it is also interesting to note that for a sed typical of starburst galaxies the alma sensitivity nicely matches the mid / near - ir sensitivity of jwst , another major facility which will be launched in 2013 , i.e. when alma will be already fully operating . these two facilities will be fully complementary for the investigation of faint distant galaxies that are out of reach for current observatories . even in its compact configuration alma will have a resolution high enough ( @xmath75 ) to make the confusion noise negligible , which is instead one of the main limitations of current surveys with single dish telescopes . the excellent alma resolution will allow astronomers to identify the optical / near - ir counterpart of mm - submm sources without ambiguities . the optical / near - ir counterpart may provide the redshift of the galaxy / agn through optical / near - ir followup spectroscopy . however , alma will directly provide the redshift of the mm / submm sources through the detection of molecular lines or fine structure atomic lines . [ fig_lines_z ] shows the observed frequency of the co rotational transitions as a function of redshift overlaid on the alma frequency bands . at z@xmath43 at least two co transitions are observable within band 3 ( the most sensitive one ) , therefore unambiguously providing the redshift of the source . at z@xmath363 the redshift confirmation requires the observation an additional co line in a higher frequency band . [ fig_alma_lines ] illustrates the alma sensitivity for the detection of the co(65 ) line ( which in smgs is close to the peak of the co lines intensities , * ? ? ? * ) for a galaxy with @xmath73 . alma will clearly be able to detect this co transition in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) out to z@xmath05 . note that to scale the diagram in fig . [ fig_alma_lines ] to other fir luminosities one has to keep in mind the non - linear relation between @xmath21 and @xmath5 ( fig . [ fig_fir_co ] ) . 158@xmath1 m line fluxes expected for a galaxy with @xmath73 as a function of redshift ( keep in mind that the luminosity of these lines does not scale linearly with @xmath5 ) . _ dashed lines : _ sensitivity of alma ( 24 hours of integration ) for a 5@xmath31 detection of emission lines ( width of 300 km / s ) in the frequency bands corresponding to the co(65 ) and [ cii ] redshifted lines . here i have only considered the frequencies around the center of the bands and far from deep atmospheric absorption features ( tab . [ tab_alma ] ) , and i have neglected band 5 ( which has currently much lower sensitivity because available only for 6 antennas ) . the [ cii ] luminosity was inferred by fitting to the @xmath49}/l_{fir}$ ] relation reported in @xcite . the co luminosity was inferred by assuming the @xmath76 relation in fig.[fig_fir_co ] and by assuming the relative luminosities of the co transitions observed in smm j16359 + 6612 ( z=2.5 ) by @xcite . ] at z@xmath47 only co transitions higher than ( 65 ) will be observable within the alma bands . however , such high transitions are generally little excited in most galaxies @xcite and therefore more difficult to observe relative to the lower transitions . yet , already at z@xmath41 the strong [ cii]158@xmath1 m line will be observable in the alma bands , and it will be one of the main tools to identify the redshift of distant sources , and in particular at z@xmath47 ( fig . [ fig_lines_z ] ) . fig . [ fig_alma_lines ] shows that in lirgs ( @xmath77 ) alma will be able to detect [ cii ] out to z@xmath010 . note that also in this case the diagram can not be scaled linearly to other fir luminosities , since the relation between @xmath49}$ ] and @xmath5 is not linear @xcite . the second brightest line is generally [ oi]63@xmath1 m ( in some objects this line is even stronger than [ cii ] , but in some exceptional objects it may be self - absorbed ) . [ oi]63@xmath1 m will be observable at z@xmath44 in the alma bands , and will help to obtain the redshift confirmation along with the [ cii ] detection . the [ oiii]88@xmath1 m line is also generally relatively strong , especially if an agn is present ( @xmath78}\\sim 0.5 - 0.3 ~f_{[cii]}$ ] ) , and can be detected with alma at high redshifts . however , since [ oi ] and [ oiii ] will be observable at high - z mostly in the high frequency bands , which are the least sensitive , the detection of these lines will probably be limited to ulirgs ( unless chemical evolutionary effects favor the emission of these oxygen lines , as discussed below ) . the far - ir emission inferred from the mm / submm thermal continuum sed , along with the redshift inferred from the co , [ cii ] and [ oi ] lines , will allow alma to provide a self - consistent , unbiased view of the evolution of the star formation rate through the cosmic epochs . for what concerns high - z agns , alma will allow us to directly trace the coevolution of black hole growth ( through the x - ray and optical emission ) and of the formation of stellar mass in the host galaxies ( through the far - ir emission ) . as discussed in [ sec_past_agn_highz ] , current mm / submm studies have found tentative indications of this co - evolution for very luminous systems ( @xmath79 ) ; alma will extend this investigation to much more quiescent systems ( @xmath80 ) , more representative of the bulk of the galaxy population at high redshift . the luminosity of the co emission will provide the molecular gas mass for most of these galaxies and , when compared with the sfr , will provide a direct measure of the star formation efficiency ( i.e. the star formation per unit gas mass ) as a function of redshift . in high redshift galaxies ( z@xmath41 ) the angular resolution of alma will allow us to resolve morphologies on sub - kpc scales . besides providing the extension of the star formation activity and the distribution of the molecular gas , the alma maps will deliver precious information on the gas dynamics . by resolving rotation curves it will be possible to constrain the dynamical mass of individual galaxies , which can be compared with the expectations by hierarchical models of galaxy evolution . in the case of qsos and type 1 agns it will be possible to directly compare the galaxy dynamical mass to the black hole mass ( inferred from the broad optical / uv emission lines ) , therefore tracing any putative evolution of the @xmath81 relation . the observed evolution of the latter relation as a function of redshift will be directly comparable with the predictions of models dealing with the galaxy - bh co - evolution @xcite , and will therefore provide tight constraints on the same models . the dynamics and morphology of the molecular gas will also provide information on the agn fuelling mechanism . in [ sec_past_agn_local ] we saw that local agns do not show obvious systematic signatures of nuclear fuelling from the host galaxy , but also that such low luminosity agns do not actually require large fuelling from the host galaxy to maintain their low accretion rates . the fuelling demand from the host galaxy is however much larger in powerful qsos , whose accretion rates may exceed a few @xmath82 . therefore , it is important to trace the dynamics of the molecular gas in the host of these powerful qsos , and investigate for instance whether in these systems gas funneled by bars or driven by galaxy merging is common . however , such luminous qsos are not found in the local universe , while are abundant at high redshift . current facilities are in general unable to resolve the molecular gas dynamics in such distant systems , with very few exceptions . alma will allow us to trace in detail the gas dynamics in a large number of qso hosts at high redshift and to statistically investigate the occurrence of various possible fuelling mechanisms . detailed simulations are already being performed to assess the detectability and capability of resolving molecular gas morphologies in high - z agns . @xcite showed that not only alma will be able to resolve and detect the molecular gas in the host galaxy , but also the 100 pc gaseous torii expected to surround most of the supermassive black holes at z@xmath02 . 63@xmath1 m to [ cii]158@xmath1 m intensity ratio as a function of galaxy age , by assuming the chemical evolutionary model in @xcite . the model also assumes log(u)=-2.5 , @xmath83 and that the excitation conditions do not change over time . courtesy of m. kaufman . ] the alma detection of multiple molecular and atomic lines in high - z galaxies and qsos will also provide precious information on the chemical evolutionary status of the galaxy . for instance , the ratio of [ oi]63@xmath1 m and [ cii]158@xmath1 m is sensitive to the relative abundance of oxygen and carbon c / o . since carbon is subject to a delayed enrichment with respect to oxygen ( by several 100 myr ) , the c / o abundance ratio is a sensitive tracer of the evolutionary stage of a galaxy . fig . [ fig_kauf ] shows the expected @xmath8463\\mu m}/l_{[cii]158\\mu m}$ ] ratio as a function of the age of a galaxy , by exploiting the chemical models in @xcite ( the model assumes the physical conditions derived for the qso at z=6.4 , as discussed in @xcite , and that the excitation conditions do not change over time ) . therefore , by measuring both these lines , alma will allow us to constrain the evolutionary stage of distant galaxies . in particular , it will be extremely interesting to investigate the c / o abundance ratio in agns and galaxies at z@xmath07 , close to the re - ionization epoch , where the age of the universe is close to the minimum enrichment timescale for carbon ; at these redshifts the c / o ratio is expected to be very low , and therefore the [ oi]/[cii ] ratio is expected to be very high . in very luminous high - z sources , such as the qsos already detected with current facilities , alma will be able to easily detect several other molecular ( e.g. hcn , hco@xmath13 , ... ) and atomic ( e.g. [ nii]122@xmath1 m ) transitions , which will allow us to perform an accurate modelling of the physics of the ism and to infer accurate chemical abundances ( hence the evolutionary stage of the system ) . as an example , fig . [ fig_wotten ] shows the simulated alma spectrum ( 24 hours of integration ) of a quasar with the same redshift ( z=6.4 ) and luminosity of the qso j1148 + 5251 , which is currently the most distant qso with a co detection . beside the co(65 ) transition , the 8 ghz alma band is expected to reveal several other molecular transitions with excellent signal - to - noise . finally , alma will allow us to investigate in detail the evolution of dust production in the early universe . the dust mass in galaxies can only be inferred by measuring the ( rest - frame ) infrared to submm sed . currently dust masses have been measured only for very powerful systems at high - z ( qsos and smgs ) , providing an incomplete and very biased view , not representative of the global evolution of dust through the cosmic epochs . alma will measure the dust mass in large samples of high - z systems , even in relatively quiescent ones ( sfr of a few @xmath82 ) . therefore , it will be possible to trace the evolution of dust mass as a function of redshift and for different classes of galaxies , which can be directly compared with models of dust evolution @xcite . in particular , it will be important to clarify whether dust produced by sne can actually be the main source of dust in the early universe , or whether other mechanisms of dust production are required @xcite . i am grateful to the organizers of the school for their kind invitation . i thank m. walmsley , p. caselli , k. wada and l. testi for many useful comments on the manuscript . i am grateful to c. dowell , a. beelen , a. marconi , m. kaufman and a. wotten for providing some of the figures in these lecture notes . some of the images were reproduced with kind permission of the space telescope science institute and of the european southern observatory . finally , i acknowledge financial support by the national institute for astrophysics ( inaf ) and by the italian space agency ( asi ) .", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_130", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) is one of the largest ground - based astronomy projects ..."}

{"question": "上下文中的'那位女士'指的是什么？", "answer": "She", "context": "Softball pitcher Courtney Kessell, Kailua High School's freshman sensation a year ago, would have nothing of the sophomore jinx. Kessell evoked high expectations after an impressive state tournament last season in which she nearly led the Surfriders to the championship. This year, Kessell not only met those expectations, she may have even surpassed them in helping Kailua (16-0) to its first state title since 1997. Her strong finish in 2002 elevated her from honorable mention status in the O'ahu Interscholastic Association Eastern Division to a spot on the all-state first team, and her recently completed season lofted her into recognition as The Advertiser's State Player of the Year after a vote of coaches and media. \"[隐藏] had the press, and she lived up to it,\" Kamehameha coach Ty Sing Chow said after Kessell pitched a four-hitter and struck out eight in the state championship victory over the Warriors. Kessell is joined on the all-state first team by teammates Loke Lastimosa, Danielle Young and Kamaile Hughes. Lastimosa, a senior, was selected as a third baseman although she finished the season as a shortstop. She hit and fielded both of her positions well. Young, a senior, patrolled center field with similar range and a strong arm, and she provided solid hitting and good speed from her leadoff spot in the Surfriders' potent batting lineup. Hughes, a sophomore, batted cleanup and was a threat to clear the fence any time she came to bat. She hit .435 during the OIA season. Kamehameha and Mililani each placed three players on the first team. The Warriors were represented by sophomore second baseman Liane Horiuchi, junior catcher Kaulana Gould and junior utility player Brandi Peiler. Horiuchi took over for 2002 All-State second baseman Samantha Sardinha and also replaced current University of Hawai'i infielder Ashley Ruff as the leadoff batter. She filled both roles admirably, hitting .395 during the Interscholastic League of Honolulu season with four home runs, 14 runs and 12 RBIs and stealing 13 bases as well as providing solid defense. Gould batted .361 with eight RBIs and showed a strong arm in throwing out base stealers. Peiler was a first-team all-state outfielder the previous two years but this season came through with several clutch pitching performances, including a shutout victory over Punahou in the ILH championship game. She was perhaps the state's most complete player, offering strong defensive play in left field and batting .462 during the regular season, and also going 3-0 as a pitcher with a perfect game and a no-hitter, plus a combined no-hitter. She also pitched a shutout of Mililani in the state semifinals. Mililani's all-state trio consists of junior shortstop Charity Senas, senior center fielder B.J. Shimamoto and senior pitcher Miki Asamura. Senas showed great range and a strong arm in the field and offered power hitting and speed as a leadoff batter. She batted .565 during the OIA season with five home runs and 23 RBIs. Shimamoto hit .300 with eight stolen bases and put pressure on pitchers and defenses with her speed. She is a three-time Advertiser All-State selection. Asamura, another repeat selection, went 8-1 during the OIA season with a 0.42 ERA and 86 strikeouts.

This study found that expert nurses with more than 10 years of dialysis experience were more effective at detecting and correcting errors compared with non-experts, particularly for procedurally based errors. Barletta JF, Barletta GM, Brophy PD, Maxvold NJ, Hackbarth RM, Bunchman TE. Pediatr Nephrol. 2006;21:842-845. [隐藏] authors identified errors associated with continuous renal replacement therapy and found that use of industry-prepared, rather than manually compounded, minimized errors. Kliger AS. Blood Purif. 2006;24:19-21. The author offers a 5-point plan to help recognize and prevent errors in dialysis facilities. The investigators analyzed electronic records and found that dosing errors were common in ambulatory care settings for patients with renal insufficiency. They conclude that computerized decision support systems should be implemented in ambulatory care. Treatments delivered in the home carry the potential for certain risks. This commentary examines the literature on dialysis-related incidents occurring in the home setting and presents a framework to help address avoidable adverse events in home hemodialysis. Patients with chronic kidney failure are at high risk for adverse events from treatment errors. This publication raises awareness of safety in end-stage renal disease care, explores factors specific to this setting that contribute to failure, and describes techniques for clinicians to reduce risk of errors. Kliger AS. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2015;10:688-695. Failure to consider human factors and poor communication can contribute to dialysis treatment errors. This commentary discusses safety concerns in dialysis facilities, including medication errors, patient falls, and health care–associated infections. The authors recommend human factors engineering, patient engagement, and simulation as promising strategies to enhance safety in this setting. Ulrich B, Kear T. Nephrol Nurs J. 2014;41:459-476. This study utilized AHRQ patient safety culture surveys to assess nephrology nursing practices across the country. The survey revealed an overall interest in patient safety and teamwork, but also identified numerous areas for improvements, including handoffs, infection control, and medication errors. This commentary relates how bullying and other disruptive behaviors remain a pervasive issue in health care. The authors describe its impact on safety culture and highlight six standards to help address behaviors that hinder communication and transparency. Reilly JB, Marcotte LM, Berns JS, Shea JA. Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf. 2013;39:70-76. In this study, communication between inpatient and outpatient dialysis units at discharge was highly variable. An elderly man presented to an emergency department (ED) with new onset chest pain. In reviewing the patient's electronic medical record (EMR), the ED physician noted a history of \"PE,\" but the patient denied ever having a pulmonary embolus. Further investigation in the EMR revealed that, many years earlier, the abbreviation was intended to stand for \"physical examination.\" Someone had mistakenly copied and pasted PE under past medical history, and the error was carried forward for years. A woman with end-stage renal disease, who often skipped dialysis sessions, was admitted to the hospital with fever and given intravenous opiates for pain. Because her permanent arteriovenous graft was clotted, she had been receiving dialysis via a temporary femoral catheter, increasing her risk for infection. Blood cultures grew yeast; the patient was diagnosed with fungal endocarditis, likely caused by injections of opiates through her catheter.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_144", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "Wilkinson WE, Cauble LA, Patel VL.

{"question": "上下文中的'不真实的陈述'指的是什么？", "answer": "Lie", "context": "George Zimmerman’s online auction to sell the pistol he used to fatally shoot Trayvon Martin had reached $485,000 on Friday morning. The bids were switched from GunBroker.com, which eventually said it wanted “no part in the listing on our website or in any of the publicity it is receiving,” to United Gun Group. The new location deems itself a “social marketplace for the firearms community.” Bidding on the 9mm Kel-Tec PF-9 pistol started at $5,000. Read more. This sicko, who posted a photo of Trayvon Martin’s body with the brag “Z-man is a one man army” on social media, is now seeking to profit from Martin’s death and further bragging about his killing. “Depraved” doesn’t seem to be a strong enough word to describe this wretched punk. Agreed. By Torah law, one may not derive benefit from the gun. Yet this repulsive fellow is using it for his personal profit. Which law?! Don’t make up your own laws, and call them Torah laws. The only punk in this story was Martin, who did not hesitate pummeling without mercy, who was exhibiting a typical burglary casing behavior such as walking between houses in the middle of the night, who had numerous marijuana and violence texts and pictures on his phone, who was suspended from school for possessing marijuana, who had marijuana in his system at the time his death. Nothing like that 12 year old kid picture circulated by the communist media – in five years from that picture to his death, Martin has morphed into a menacing street criminal complete with a gold grill and a nasty attitude. He had candy in his pocket?-Are you insinuating that anyone with a candy is incapable of committing a violent crime?! 1) “Walking between houses in the middle of the night”. He was walking on footpaths that were meant for pedestrians – in other words doing nothing wrong whatsoever. Later he was running on footpaths to escape Zimmerman, because he was afraid of the stranger suspiciously following him. 2) “Marijuana in his system” – what does that have to do with anything? 3) Zimmerman refused to listen to the 911 dispatcher who told him to back off. Had he done so, a teenager who had done nothing wrong would have continued home, unharmed. 4) Zimmerman posted a picture of Martin’s body, bragging about the shooting. 5) Zimmerman followed another man into a parking lot and threatened to shoot him in a road rage incident. 6) He posted online filthy pictures of a woman he was angry at. 7) He pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend and threatened her. 8) He pointed a gun in his wife’s face and hit her father. Following the letter of the law, Zimmerman was acquired of the murder charge – it was legally self-defense, albeit against a scared teenager who attacked a stranger who was following him. However, Zimmerman is clearly a thuggish punk who has a history of threatening people with guns, especially wives and girlfriends. Oh, did I forget racist too? Yep, he’s posted several such those comments. You are the one admiring a violent street thug named Martin, complete with the gold grill(very popular with gang members), taking phone pictures of guns, texting with his friends about fights and drugs. Oh, did you forget about pummeling Zimmerman. Pummeling someone means mercilessly hitting another human being in the head until a traumatic brain injury or death. Someone in his first fight doesn’t have enough cruelty to just keep on hitting; it is very probable that Martin has done it before. Martin was walking in the middle of the night in a place where it wasn’t customary and was suspicious, especially in the face of recent burglaries. Marijuana may or may not be a safe drug, but it definitely is illegal, Martin was involved with it, which is another proof that Martin was not this 12 year old innocent candy-lover that the media tried so hard to portray. Regarding Zimmerman, all the character flaws are inferred from his alleged behavior after the severe psychological trauma of the Martin incident, after the media’s tarring and feathering to such an extent that Zimmerman’s public reputation and employment opportunities are ruined, after spending all of his family’s life savings to hire attorneys to defend against a typical governmental bullying tactic of prosecuting just for the purpose of prosecuting so that the target person buckles under pressure and takes a plea deal. Not even discussing the fact that most of your violent behavior by Zimmerman allegations are just words of other people without any physical proof; people, who may hate Zimmerman because of Martin or because of personal reasons, who understand very well the vulnerability of Zimmerman to allegations of violence, and it is no surprise that they may take advantage of the situation and hurt the man even further by their allegations. Regarding your feeble point of not listening to the 911 operator – Zimmerman was surveillancing from a distance until Martin went around and suddenly jumped Zimmerman; besides, gratefully, a citizen of this country doesn’t yet have to obey every Herr Bureaucrat on the other end of the phone line. Calling Zimmerman racist?!-There were no any proven racist statements attributable to Zimmerman; the only racists in this story were Obama and the rest of the fascist socialists, who could not care less about the horrible epidemic of black people being shot by other black people or by Latinos, but getting all righteously angry because this particular Latino happened to have a Jewish last name of Zimmerman. More lies, distortions and flat-out ridiculous conjecture, both in defense of Zimmerman, an unrepentant punk and attacking Martin, his victim. 1) You are the one admiring a violent street thug named Martin… A lie. Actually two lies; [隐藏] #1: No one “admired” him or said he was a good guy; if anything the opposite was said when saying Zimmerman’s acquittal was legally just. Lie #2: “Violent Street Thug”? Would this be Martin with zero arrests? Or Zimmerman, who had a previous arrest for attacking a cop and a previous restraining order placed by his girlfriend? 2) You “forgive” every single one of Zimmerman’s subsequent violent incidents, including those where guns and death-threats are used, because of “psychological trauma” caused by his arrest and trial in the Martin case? He now has a lifetime get-out-of-jail-free card because of that arrest? Are you insane? 3) “…a citizen of this country doesn’t yet have to obey every Herr Bureaucrat on the other end of the phone line.” Saying that Zimmerman should’ve listened to the 911 operator is the equivalent of Nazism? Once again, are you insane? Your post is so riddled with idiocies (do you even know what “inferred” means? are you aware of Zimmerman raising a large amount of money, then illegally lying in court about it?) that only a few of them are addressed here. But hey, keep defending this creep even after his next domestic violence episode(s); nothing is his fault. 1 So now you get all angry when accused of admiring Martin, while it was you who first accused me of admiring Zimmerman; typical liberal hypocrisy. You lied: Zimmerman had no arrests prior to the Martin incident, while Martin got kicked out of school for being involved with drugs and violence. 2 Try to take a course in reading comprehension, as you missed my point that Zimmerman at the time of the incident was a good boy, while Martin was bad, involved with gang lifestyle, violence and drugs. Whatever Zimmerman allegedly turned into after the incident, has no relevance to assessing his character at the incident. 3 So do we have to obey every gubmit employee or do we have constitutional rights?! Please answer, Herr Kommandant!!! 4 So can you bring an actual instance of Zimmerman’s racist statements?-Muslim is a religion, not a race, and you have no other racist statements by Zimmerman, so here you lie again. As for you referring to my post as riddled with idiocies, I won’t argue with an apparent expert, as it takes one to know one. I have made all my points, some multiple times, and will not further reply to your ignorance and lies. PS please look up inferred in a Webster’s dictionary. 1) You are a liar and/or don’t know what you’re talking about. Zimmerman was arrested in 2005, several years before he shot Martin. He also had a restraining order filed against him in 2005 for domestic violence. 2) Martin was suspended from school three times, not “kicked out”, i.e. expelled. His suspensions were for graffiti and marijuana. “Gang lifestyle”? Pretty wimpy gang. Violence? Another lie. Drugs? Marijuana. 3) “Herr Kommandant!!!” You love calling people you disagree with “Nazis”, don’t you? What a sicko. 4) Trying to play semantic games by saying a bigot isn’t a racist? First of all, bigots are usually called racists too, whether their bigotry is religious or race based. Second of all, he is clearly a vile bigot, so I’m not sure what you’re trying to prove – that he’s “only” a bigot but not a racist? Third of all, he called President Obama an “ignorant baboon” in a post, so there’s your racist statement. 5) When someone commits domestic violence against several different women over the years, including threatening some with guns, fights with a cop, follows another motorist into a parking lot and threatens to kill him, and several other incidents, character flaws aren’t “inferred”. Look up what the word means. Here’s a hint – we don’t “infer” that the sun rises in the East. This pistol fetched such a high price because people understand its meaning as a symbol of freedom: it didn’t just save a life(and there can be no freedom when people are petrified of street gangsters) of one individual from a violent bully, it also symbolizes a court victory of an individual against a bullying federal government which tried to railroad an innocent man for political reasons. The bidders understand, and they put their dollars where their appreciation for freedom is. Will this cause riots?-Not in a state where people are armed and able to defend themselves. The street thugs attack those who look like easy targets. He is a sicko and so are the bidders, but since the USA are not supposed to be the jungle, authorities should confiscate the gun.

In the first half of this year alone we have seen some major announcements from Google [隐藏]Words that have shaken up the world of ecommerce and paid advertising in 2016. During the Google Performance Summit held earlier this year the search giant introduced new upgrades, features, designs and product types to its AdWords and Analytics platforms. We take a look at the four that caught our attention in relation to paid advertising. High on Google’s list of things to do for 2017 is the redesign of its AdWords user interface. This is because many people find the current AdWords dashboard to be quite tricky when it comes to finding the data and insights you need. The new interface is designed to bring the most important features together to allow a quick overview of the campaign. This will allow all parties to better communicate account insights and facts and redirect your attention to optimising elements that have the most impact. Pay-per-Click helps you target your ads to customers in certain countries, regions or cities – or within a set distance from your business or shop. Your business gets found by people on Google precisely when they’re searching for the things that you offer. In February this year Google announced that it was doing away with right side ads in a bid to bring uniformity to the Google experience across devices. With this came the introduction of expanded text ads. What this means for advertisers is that headlines are now much bigger as in two 30-character headlines bigger. This is a step up from the single headline with just 25 characters. This has huge implications for advertisers. Google has already reported a 25% increase in click through rates for advertisers as a result of the change.

{"question": "上下文中的'位于伊比利亚半岛的国家'指的是什么？", "answer": "Spain", "context": "The words alcohol and America don’t sit comfortably together in my mind. Understandably, since my father fell hard to alcoholism while living his last years in a kooky town on the Californian coast, which had only one way in, and one way out… He was also addicted to prescription drugs, which he bought by the ton-load over the Internet. But there is another connection between the US and alcohol in my psyche: an American gave me my first alcoholic drink. I was four years old. She was a neighbour, and had a birthday party for her daughter; having recently moved from the States, she got her Apple Juice and Apple Cider mixed up. When my mum came to pick me up some hours later, I was lying beneath the living room table: I staggered home along the pavement, my fairy wings bent. These are two defining moments: I won’t go back to California after the hellish week my brother and I spent trying to get my father into a rehabilitation centre, after the nightmare of negotiating his medical bills after the fourth or fifth overdose; and one could argue that the said American introducing me to alcohol gave me a taste, which I abused somewhat through my adolescence and 20s… But these are both other stories. Though the two events popped up in my mind last night after a conversation I had at a dinner party at the weekend. It was about the Little Angel Marionette Theatre’s production of the ‘Very Old Man with Enormous Wings’. The comment was made by an American mother at my daughter’s school who had taken her son to the performance, but had been shocked at what she saw were ‘inappropriate’ scenes that involved copious drinking. I should add here that the Little Angel Marionette Theatre is a puppet theatre, and is primarily a family venue, though some performances are more grown-up than others. This one welcomed a minimum age of six. The moral is that the village turns into a money-making tourist trap and everyone becomes corrupted, even the priest who turns to cocktails and ends up getting jiggy with the village woman (please keep in mind that they are puppets, so you wouldn’t call this explicit). I was a bit sleepy at this point and lulled by the dark auditorium, put my head back and had a little snooze. So when American mother questioned me about the scene my response was to dismiss it: ‘Oh, it would have gone straight over my daughter’s head.’ But it did get me thinking, particularly as I have witnessed the destruction of alcohol first hand. On going home I read Marquez’s story and saw that the production company had changed the setting from Marquez’s [隐藏] to a British seaside town, and that the boozy bit was also an addition. Who, after all, would hang out in a British seaside town without a bit of booze and brawl? I walked away from the dinner party thinking it was important that I acknowledge the possible insidious affects of this kind of performance on the tender mind of my young daughter, but I was also sorry that it took away from the overall magic of the story. The puppets were sublime, particularly that of the old man. What a beautiful ending when he finally stretches his wings and reaches out to the sky, and escapes the community who had judged him, used him, and kept him caged. This entry was posted in Theatre and tagged advertising, alcohol, American culture, British culture, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, literature, Little Angel Marionette Theatre, Old Man with Enormous Wings, theatre, writing. Bookmark the permalink. I was shocked when I went to university at the blatant advertising of drink, and getting drunk, from freshers’ week to discounted nights in the Union. It’s like, university prepares you for life, work, fending for yourself, supposedly, but does it also prepare you for going out every night with your mates and drinking tons of beers and being the last man standing? I didn’t even question it till my dad fell ill, then I had a totally different perspective on what I had spent the past 15 odd years of my life doing – basically getting drunk.

{"question": "上下文中的'这个位于英吉利海峡的岛屿'指的是什么？", "answer": "So", "context": "There are a lot of amazing benefits of avocado. Avocado is used in many ways including foods, cooking oil and cosmetics. Avocado has a lot of vitamins and mineral such as calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium, etc. Besides, avocado is rich in fiber but less in sugar and starch. Monounsaturated fatty acids contained in avocado also help to control the metabolism in the body. [隐藏] what are amazing benefits of avocado? Today, I’ll share you with the amazing benefits of avocado to our health. One of benefits of avocado is to prevent cancers. Avocado contains important vegetable compounds which is supportive in cancer prevention. Furthermore, antioxidants in avocado like glutathione, vitamin C and E, and carotenoids may prevent oral (mouth) cancer, skin and prostate cancer. Another benefits of avocado is to help you lose your weight. With protein and fiber, avocado helps to manage the hunger and make you feel full for a long time. Unsaturated fats in avocado have effect on balancing calorie in the body. Contents of the nutrients which are good for health such as omega-3, carotenoids and vitamins have effects on treating and preventing inflammation in the body. Many studies showed that essential oil extracted from avocado and soya beans may reduce inflammation as well as osteoarthritis. Many researchers found that vitamin E in avocado may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease up to 30 – 40 percents. Also, unsaturated fats including monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may lower blood cholesterol level to avoid cardiovascular diseases. Amazing benefits of avocado also impress in eye protection. Content of monounsaturated fatty acids in avocado may reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataract. Additionally, antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin have effects on protecting the eyes by improving the absorption of carotenoids. Avocado is not only used for healthy, but also for beauty. Let’s figure out some of remarkable benefits of avocado’s contents in improving the skin. Fatty acid: maintain the moisture of the skin and make it smoother. Vitamin E: remove free radicals which can inhibit the cells; therefore, it slows down aging process. Vitamin E can also support in healing the bruises. Vitamin C: increase collagen production and elasticity of the skin. Vitamin A: boost collagen production, remove dead skin and keep the skin cells healthy. Vitamin B: reduce damage caused by free radicals, make skin fresh and glory. Potassium and phosphorus: make hair and skin healthy. Vitamin D: maintain calcium level which is good for bones and teeth. Avocado is rich in potassium but less in sodium so that it may help to balance electrolytes and blood pressure in the body. Some studies showed that good fats contained in avocado also have a key role in lowering blood pressure; however, those who suffer from high blood pressure (hypertensive patients) should strictly follow their doctor’s advice if it is alright to consume avocado. Although avocado brings a lot of advantages to our health, too much consumption is bad. There are some notices while consuming avocado. Cause an allergy: Some people who are too sensitive, avocado may cause nettle rash (hives), or redness, or nausea, digestive problems, etc. Harm your liver: Some studies found that estragole and anethole may hurt the liver. People who have problems with liver should avoid this fruit. In case you really love to try avocado, you had better get consultancy from your doctor. Gain weight: If you consume avocado in limit amount, it can help you control the weight. In case of consuming much, avocado may make you gain weight. Reduce good cholesterol: When there is an overconsumption, beta-sitosterol in avocado may absorb good cholesterol in the body that will harm the health. Impact on people having latex allergy: Some of proteins in latex that cause latex allergy contain in avocado. Latex can increase IgE antibodies in serum, so those people with latex allergy should avoid this fruit. Influence pregnant and nursing mother: When pregnant women eat avocado, amount of milk may reduced and mammary gland gets pain. Nursing mother consuming too much avocado may cause a stomachache to her baby. Affect to some medicines: Avocado is good in anti-inflammation but it can influence in efficiency of medicines.

Those symptoms … ill-feeling, confused (foggy, spacey), etc. are often also symptoms of energy or psychic attach (witting or unwitting) and just not-so-good energy. And we’re empath-sensitives ‘in the world’ as they say, so it’s good to have the roster of practices to help with that. Re your ‘education’ in dealing with Narcissists, you’ll see a couple of good posts here (in the Empath Series List), including one called “5 ways a narcissist gets in your head” (shared from a sister blog) … you’ll recognize the ‘tactics’. And it really is an education. I found it the same way. But I realized that there was also something ‘too familiar’ about it, and I realized I’d grown up with it and it had just become ‘normal’ … until I realized while it may have been ‘normal’ it wasn’t healthy. And off we go to uncondition and shift into healthier, more self-respecting relating. Thanks again for adding your voice and story to the conversation here! Hello Jamie 💓 Yes, when I feel spacey lately I say, “I release all of which isn’t mine and return it to the source of its origin. I return it to the divine light of all that is. So it is, so it is, so it is.” Also, I envision my feet on grass or earthy ground, and I saw “I am coming fully into my body. I am fully present.” Sometimes I’m not fully anchored in my body. I tend to travel alot in my sleep! Yes I did see the articles on narcissists by the lady 🙂 and all the behaviors is correct, I noticed them with my ex years ago and with the one in Philly. I had NO idea this was narcissism. I just quickly realized there was emotional abuse going on with the Philly guy. And alot of protection. And denial. I always thought narcissism meant vanity, like she said. So it was interesting to educate myself! And yes! Codependents tend to be empaths, or empaths tend to be Codependents and we learn it from childhood – wanting to please everyone and make everything better. It’s part of our nature to want to help everyone. But it stems from a parent who is narcissistic and/or the other parent being the codependent. Yes, my parents played the dance. Thank you for sharing your story with me too 💜 Are you on Facebook or Google+? Any other way to share info and inspirations? You can find me if you’d like – Trina Otero on Facebook, Google+.. Cheers!

{"question": "上下文中的'表格中的水平条目集合'指的是什么？", "answer": "Rows", "context": "I have an issue for which I created a workaround, but now it doesn't work anymore and I don't know to how to solve it... So I hope someone has the same problem and knows a proper solution. In my dashboard I have a map with locations, a small report and multiple filters which apply to both the report and the map. Many records in my data source have the same longitude and latitude, so they are blended as one spot on the map. I want to display only the spots on the map and in the report if they require a certain number of records. So far no problems. But here comes the difficulty... Each individual record in my data source contains a hyperlink and I want to show all urls that belong to the spot on the map. Preferably clickable as wel. The workaround I created was to make an extra sheet/list with all my hyperlinks as a simple table. When I used the map or the report as a filter, this sheet was filtered as well. I added this sheet as an extra dashboard and linked the dashboards to each other. But now I don't want to use the map or report as a filter, but just the number of records in my dashboard. When I use a certain number of records as a filter for the map and report, my 'table list' sheet with hyperlinks is empty because it shows only individual records. So when I use for instance a filter for a minimum of 20 records per spot on the map and report, my corresponding list with individual hyperlinks is empty, because this list displays individual records. I attatched a sample workbook which represents my problem. In this workbook the filter for minimum number of records is applied only to the map and not to the report list. Hope someone has the same problem and knows a good workaround! Are you still looking for help with this? In sheet 3 I made a calc ([Calculation1]) that builds a string, adding on the current hyperlink to a growing list of the prior hyperlinks. On V3 of sheet 3 I just made a simple sheet of all lat/long combos and their hyperlinks. I used the new 10.5 sheet-in-a-tooltip feature that lets you display a sheet in a tooltip. Go to your MAP sheet. Hover or click on a city. There is the sheet! At this time we can't click into a sheet-in-a-tooltip though. So these are some ways to address what you are looking to do. I still needed an answer to my question so... thanks very much for your clear explanation and examples! I helped me a lot! There's just one thing I don't understand how you did it. In Dashboard 2, how did you made the filter action that only displays the sheet when you click a city on the map? But I still got the problem with filtering the minimum number of records. When I change the minimum number of records parameter in your workbook to 2 for example, both the tooltip and the hyperlinks list are empty. I hope you can help me with that part as well! Let me first address the question about Dashboard 2. I made a filter action with the Source being the Map sheet, and the Target being my new sheet. I specifically pass selected fields of Lat and Long. So in my sheet, only the rows that correspond with those values display. The key thing is to check \"Exclude all values\" as shown below. That way the little report sheet clears out when you clear the selection off the Map sheet. And then I can just pass the hyperlink field (as you did on Dashboard 1) to the hyperlink action (Hyperlink 2) to get to the link. Regarding the filter... That is evaluating at the row level. So for every row, the value for Number of Records is always 1. I created a FIXED LOD to tell me how many rows are for each lat/long. See [[隐藏] for Lat/Long]. Then I modified the [FILTER...] calc to use that instead. (I also displayed both SUM([Number of Records]) and [Rows for Lat/Long] on the map, and on my report sheet so you can see how they behave at the row level. (On the MAP sheet you are not displaying at the row level, so get rolled up to the mark level for lat/long, and that's why you see 3 or 10, etc. But on my sheet I display at the row level (so that individual hyperlinks are accessible to the hyperlink2 action) and there you can see why number of records is 1, but the LOD value is still 3 . Thanks for your super super super clear explanation!!! I never heard of the FIXED LOD function. This really solves my issue and also contributes to my Tableau knowlegde a lot! I was wondering if you also know if it is possible to show all results from Sheet3 (4) when no selection for a location on the map is made. So for instance if my Minimum # records is 1, I would like so show the full list of Sheet3(4), and when I change the Minimum # records to 5, to show just the results that belong to this filter. Edit: I still needed to apply the new filter to all sheets, now it's working. Thank's a lot! I still got another question. The workbook I added to this question is just a 'simple' version from my original one. The original one I can't share because of privacy reasons. But in my original workbook, I got a lot of filters. And the problem that I'm facing right now, is that the value for the \"Rows for Lat/Long\" has the value for all records in the data source, but my filters don't apply to this calculated field. I tried adding all filters to the \"Rows for Lat/Long\" calculated field, but I still don't get it working properly. I made another workbook with an editted data source so I can show you what I mean. In Dashboard(2), for instance, if I check just \"me\" in the filter \"person\" the Number of Records and Rows for Lat/Long don't have the same value, but I want them to. You know a solution for this problem as well? The [Rows for lat/long] calc is a FIXED LOD calc. When we do FIXED, in most cases it acts BEFORE any filters are invoked. FIXED does calcs on the full set of data coming in from the data source -- except for certain circumstances. If you want LODs to be affected by the filters, usually we go to INCLUDE and EXCLUDE LODs. These get evaluated AFTER the filters are applied. They can also be a little more confusing to get right. After you put a filter in context, the pill on the filter shelf changes to a grey color to let you know it is in context. Attached is your workbook with that filter in context.

Underneath the abrasion-resistant outer layer you'll find the highly breathable and fully waterproof hydratex membrane, go one layer deeper and there is a snug thermal liner. The combination of these three layers will see you riding through the depths of winter, but the Sand Urban will also prove its worth on the other extreme of the thermometer: the thermal liner and hydratex membrane can easily be removed and there's massive mesh vents hidden away behind the zips on the chest, arms and back. The jacket has multiple adjustability options at the waist and arms that ensure a perfect fit. [隐藏] comes with inconspicuous yet impressively effective Seesmart CE level 1 protectors in the shoulders and elbows and there is a pocket for a CE level 2 Seesoft back protector. Rev'It! is on to a massive winner in our book and has managed to combine truly impressive functionality with sleek stylish looks.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_247", "difficulty": "medium", "source_doc": "One of the staples in Revit's collection is the Sand 3, an adventure jacket that is a true Swiss arm..."}
{"question": "上下文中的'一条著名的街道'指的是什么？", "answer": "St", "context": "For families with housing vouchers in [隐藏]. Louis, even the threat of budget cuts means dramatic consequences. For people on the waitlist, it’s even worse. Adeena Crape may be one of the last people in St. Louis to receive a housing voucher—at least for a while. Crape received a call late this past November from the Housing Authority. Upon learning she could pick up her voucher, she was taken aback. Years had passed since Crape put her name on the waitlist. She had dismissed the idea that a voucher would ever come. “I'm not even sure how I got it!” Crape says. Crape applied the last time the St. Louis Housing Authority opened its waitlist—a fleeting five-day window in July 2014. Over the course of those five days, 27,708 residents of St. Louis put their names on the list. In other major cities, the demand for vouchers is just as extraordinary. The last time Chicago opened its waitlist for housing aid, 260,000 households applied. With that many people in the pool, the Chicago Housing Authority held a random lottery, advancing only one in every five families to the voucher waitlist. Nationwide, around 3 million families are on voucher waitlists. If the waitlists weren’t closed, the number might be as high as 9 million families. In the coming months, Congress will make decisions that may dramatically shape Crape’s monthly housing payments, and possibly even her status as a voucher holder. With budget cuts looming, public housing authorities across the country are preparing to shrink their Housing Choice Voucher programs. Philosophically, staff in St. Louis and elsewhere will have to decide on the lesser of two evils: cut the number of vouchers or slash the value that vouchers provide. Today, the St. Louis Housing Authority is working its way through the waitlist chronologically—and they have yet to review applicants who signed up after day one of that five-day reprieve back in 2014. That Crape spent years on the waitlist is strikingly typical. According to HUD, 35 percent of voucher holders spend more than three years on waitlists—and 15 percent spend more than five years waiting. “You know, it’s so hard out here. I know people on the waitlist 10 years, 8 years, 6 years,” Crape says. St. Louis’s long line to a voucher is a testament to the pent-up demand for affordable housing. Nationwide, only one out of every four eligible households receive support. For those without assistance, conditions are worsening; between 2013 and 2015, HUD reports, the number of severely rent-burdened households increased by more than half a million. Against this backdrop, federal allocations are positioned to shrink services, shifting the costs to the individual. Cuts will disproportionately burden black women. In St. Louis, black people account for 94 percent of voucher holders. More than 80 percent are women-headed homes. For a city where almost a quarter of renters spend 50 percent or more of their income on housing, fewer federal dollars would mean more residents fighting housing insecurity. Receiving a voucher does not necessarily ensure that recipients will be able to obtain safe, affordable housing. Folks like Crape are already navigating a rental landscape in St. Louis in which housing stock is increasingly limited and landlords regularly discriminate against voucher holders, despite the fact that this practice is illegal within city limits. Further, just last year during budget negotiations, more than a thousand vouchers nationwide were rescinded while families attempted to secure units, sending them back to the waitlist. Cheryl Lovell, the executive director of the St. Louis Housing Authority, administers vouchers to just under 7,000 households in the city and neighboring county. Just before the new year, HUD notified housing authorities of possible budget cuts based on Congressional proposals. The letter told directors to anticipate anywhere from a one to five percent cut in voucher program funding. “I know our funding is going to go down, but I don't know by how much,” Lovell says. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that, under the last Senate bill, 25,000 households nationwide would drop off the voucher program in a year—this, even though the bill increases HUD’s overall funding. The House bill is significantly harsher, cutting an estimated 105,000 households from the program. Put into further perspective, the budget Trump gave to Congress would cut around 235,000 households nationwide as part of the largest proposed cut to HUD since the Reagan era. While waiting for last year’s budget to pass, Lovell says industry groups predicted that funding would renew only 95 percent of her budget. The 5 percent gap would have been enough to create a small crisis, had it materialized. Given the uncertainty, Lovell was forced into the precarious position of cutting her own program. To mitigate the potential damage, the Housing Authority’s Board of Commissioners decided to cut costs. They froze the waitlist for the first time since a nearly two-year period in 2014, meaning no names would come off the waitlist when vouchers became available. “Our first reaction, if the money gets cut substantially, is to just stop leasing to new tenants,” says Lovell. Once the office stopped providing vouchers to applicants from the waitlist, attrition reduced the program. “Thirty-five to 40 households will fall off the program every month, and you hope that this makes up for the money that you've lost.” By not replacing these spots with families from the waitlist, Lovell’s program can be reduced by about 450 vouchers in a given year, if needed to fill a budget gap. When the federal budget passed in May 2017, the St. Louis voucher program received more funding than expected. Still, the waitlist remained frozen for three months after the budget passed. “The leasing process itself takes a fairly long time to gear back up—so you stop and you start,” Lovell says. An uncertain budget increases inefficiencies. The line Lovell walks was especially thin in 2013. That year, a gridlocked Congress triggered the across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. As a result, housing authorities nationwide faced a 6 percent gap in voucher funding. When housing authorities run out of other options, they sometimes turn to watering down the payment standard, or value, of vouchers. Payment standards are the maximum amount of subsidy a household can receive. When payment standards go down, tenants have a harder time making ends meet. Plus, their pool of available units is further restricted. For households moving between homes in St. Louis during the summer of 2013, the support they received plummeted. The Housing Authority’s idea was to reduce each voucher holder’s support just enough to avoid knocking anyone off the program. Instead of receiving vouchers worth 110 percent of an area’s fair market rent (the maximum), their vouchers’ values sank to 95 percent. Vouchers no longer stretched as far. For example, in fiscal year 2013, a voucher for a two-bedroom unit within the city covered up to $871 of rent and utilities. Under these new payment standards and the 2013 budget, only up to $788 would be covered. “This shifts more costs onto low-income households, who either must pay more to remain in their current housing or move to lower cost, lower quality housing,” writes Douglas Rice, senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a result, in St. Louis, fewer families were able to move out of the region’s high-poverty areas, where vouchers are already concentrated within lines of racial segregation. Policy changes fenced them in: The Housing Authority denied all tenant requests to move to homes in higher-cost areas. This, despite the program’s promise in increasing residents’ choices. In May 2013, the housing authority sent a letter outlining program cutbacks to landlords, appealing to their goodwill. Staff, bracing for cuts, planned to decrease payment standards for all tenants, thereby increasing rent burden, with as little as 30 days warning. The letter asked landlords to voluntarily defer rent increases and reduce rent by 5 percent. Lovell admits, “These two attempts to reduce cost were not very successful.” Only two landlords deferred rent increases. No landlords reduced rent. When facing cuts, even housing authorities are less likely to meet tenants half way. Leeway within programs—such as a payment plan for shifting income—can make the difference between a family keeping and losing their voucher. “But when you're trying to control the cost and get under this cap, all the nice things you do for people, you're just like, ‘Nope, sorry, can't do that anymore,’” Lovell says. Cuts to administrative funding over recent years have compounded the shrinking support that housing authorities provide to tenant-landlord relations. And while budget uncertainty diminished the voucher program’s pledge of social mobility, it didn’t undermine it completely. St. Louis avoided the most extreme scenario: not a single voucher was taken from a family following this budget cut. For many housing authorities nationwide it was a closer call, with tenants’ livelihoods often hanging in the balance. “We do everything else before we do that, everything. We do not want to remove a family,” Lovell says. But if it has to happen, the rule is simple: Last in, first out. Today, housing authorities everywhere, St. Louis city included, have narrower margins and shallower emergency funds than they did following sequestration. This makes the worst-case scenario—housing authorities revoking vouchers—all the more likely if the Trump administration succeeds in imposing radical austerity. With uncertain cuts looming and an administration that is anxious to dramatically reduce housing support, Crape occupies the position of “last in.” Any future cost-cutting measures in St. Louis will be made in an attempt to keep her, and other households recently awarded vouchers, in their homes.

{"question": "上下文中的'一个常用的英文连词'指的是什么？", "answer": "And", "context": "The Stroke Blog: We Want to Go with Oh to Paris! Before we get started, did you miss our big announcement last Friday? Paris is a city for the senses. [隐藏] it takes our mantra eat, see, and do, to a whole new level. The tastes - melt-in-your-mouth baguettes and rich French wines. The smells - Parisian perfumeries and subways. The sights - panoramic views from the Eiffel Tower and Arc du Triomphe, shimmering stained glass at Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle, some of the best street fashion in the world. And countless things to do - burlesque shows at the Moulin Rouge, Seine river cruises, Parisian plages, Luxembourg Gardens, shopping the Champs d'Elysees, getting lost in the Louvre. In a lifetime you couldn't begin to scratch the surface of all this city has to offer. And that's why we love it. 1. HEAR THE FOUNTAINS AT VERSAILLES. Yes, hear. You might think of Versailles as a feast for the eyes, but from April to October the fountains of Versailles come alive to the sound of classical music. We'll wander through the palace with throngs of fellow tourists, feed the ducks at the Hameau de la Reine, and ride a bike built for two around the gardens to enjoy the musical show. We'll have a lot of ground to cover - the gardens alone measure 8 square kilometers! 2. PAY OUR RESPECTS AT PÉRE LACHAISE CEMETERY. Pére Lachaise is Paris' biggest cemetery, and an art history student's dream. It's the final resting place of Chopin, Parisian architect Baron Haussmann, playwright Molière, Victor Hugo, musician Jim Morrison, Marcel Proust, Delacroix, the poet Guilliame Apollinaire, Oscar Wilde, Modigliani, and Gertrude Stein, to name a few. It's also home to many heartbreakingly beautiful sepulchres, funerary monuments, sculptures, and mausolea. Affectionately called la cité des morts (city of the dead) by locals, this cemetery feels anything but. And we can't wait to show it to you. 3. PLAY AT DISNEYLAND PARIS. Conjure up an image of Paris and it may not include amusement park rides and Mickey Mouse. But we believe that even big kids need to play once in awhile. When we Go with Oh to Paris we'll experience the magic of Disneyland - Jess' first time to a Disney theme park. Spinning tea cups, costumed characters, Space Mountain, and Fantasyland. We'll see the world through a child's eyes, if only for a day. It's a small world, after all. 4. DINE IN THE DARK. Although French food can arguably be appreciated with the eyes as much as the mouth, in Paris we'll opt for a quirky culinary experience and go dining in the dark. At other eat-in-the-dark restaurants diners and staff are given night goggles, but not here. Restaurant Dans Le Noir is the real deal. Diners and wait staff rely on their sense of smell and touch to navigate the restaurant and identify what's on their plate. We think it will make for a clumsy, messy, and fun evening. Imagine the before and after shots! 5. SEE A WORKING GUILLOTINE. Formerly working, of course. In a tiny bar in Paris' Latin Quarter a bit of Parisian history is being preserved. La Caveau des Oubliettes (roughly translated as Cave of the Forgotten) is located in a genuine 12th century prison that held prisoners awaiting the guillotine. Serving up drinks in a simultaneously chilling and warm atmosphere, only at La Caveau can you sit next to a live jazz and blues band and a 1792 working guillotine at the same time. We'll drink up (pun intended) a little piece of Paris' history, and chat up some locals about what to see when we inevitably return to the city. Because Paris - this big, beautiful, sensory delight of a city - has a way of always drawing visitors back. Help us Go with Oh to Paris!

or possibly not only cs@xmath4te , but also other cs - te compounds might form on the surface and these might give rise to photoemission at low photon energy . a hint to this might be that the ratio of evaporated atoms of each element is not corresponding to cs@xmath4te , see below . after use , we found that not only the complete spectrum shifted towards lower quantum efficiency , but also that the photoemission threshold for high qe increased to 4.1ev , which is shown in fig.[fig : cath87 ] , lower curve . one might expect that the photocathode is poisoned by the residual gas , preventing low - energy electrons from escaping . however , because typical storage lifetimes are of the order of months , the effect must be connected to either the laser light , or the electrical field . we also produced a cs - te cathode on a thin gold film of 100 nm thickness . as shown in fig.[fig : cath120 ] , the shoulder in the low energy response disappeared . it is difficult to fit a curve for the spicer model to the low energy data . the high \" photoemission threshold is at 3.5ev . at the moment , this cathode is in use in the ctf ii gun and will be remeasured in the future . in terms of lifetime , this cathode is comparable to the best cs - te cathodes , as it has already operated for 20 days in the rf - gun . as a new material presented first in @xcite , we tested rubidium - telluride . we took spectra of qe before and after use in the ctf ii gun , as for cs - te . remarkably , with this material , there was no shift in the photoemission threshold towards higher energies , but only a global shift in qe , see fig.[fig : rb2te ] . this might be due to the lower affinity of rubidium to the residual gas . detailed investigations are necessary to clarify this . long lifetimes for cs - te cathodes are achieved only when they are held under uhv ( @xmath6 mbar ) . other photocathode materials like k - sb - cs are immunized against gases like oxygen by evaporating thin films of csbr onto them @xcite . therefore , we evaporated a csbr film of 2 nm thickness onto the cs - te . fig.[fig : csbr ] shows the spectrum before the csbr film ( square points ) and after it ( round points ) . the qe at 266 nm dropped from 4.3% to 1.2% . in addition , the photoemission threshold was shifted from 3.9ev to 4.1ev . a long - term storage test showed no significant difference between uncoated and coated cathodes . more investigations will determine the usefulness of these protective layers . in order to increase the sensitivity of the on - line qe measurement during evaporation of the photocathodes , we monitored the process with light at a wavelength of 320 nm . we did not see any significant improvement in sensitivity , notably in the high qe region . film thicknesses are measured during the evaporation process by a quartz oscillator @xcite . typical thicknesses for high quantum efficiencies at @xmath7 nm are 10 nm of tellurium and around 15 nm of cesium . this results in a ratio of the number of atoms of each species of @xmath8 , far from the stoichiometric ratio of 0.5 for cs@xmath4te . it is known that tellurium interacts strongly with copper @xcite , so that not all of the evaporated tellurium is available for a compound with subsequently evaporated cesium . therefore , we used also mo and au as substrate material . however , the ratio between the constituents necessary for optimum qe , did not change significantly . another reason might be that instead of cs@xmath4te , cs@xmath4te@xmath9 is catalytically produced on the surface . this compound , as well as some others , was found to be stable @xcite . lifetime in ctf depends on parameters like maximum field strength on the cathode , vacuum and especially extracted charge . typically , a cathode is removed from the gun , if the qe falls below 1.5% . as shown in fig.[fig : lifetime ] , lifetime does not depend on the initial qe ; a cathode having an initial qe of 15% ( round points ) lasted as long as one with 5% ( triangles ) . as shown in table[tab1 ] , the average current produced in ctf ii is nearly a factor 10000 lower than what is required for the clic drive beam . a test to produce 1mc is under preparation in the photoemission laboratory at cern . the exact reproduction of the clic pulse structure would require the clic laser , which is still in the design stage .comparison of cathode relevant parameter [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] [ tab1 ] in a collaboration between rutherford appleton laboratory and cern . a test which is compatible with our current installation is the production of 1ma of dc current , which requires a uv laser power of 300mw at the cathode . for this test , we will illuminate the cathode with pulses of 100ns to 150ns pulse length , at repetition rates between 1khz and 6khz . as table[tab1 ] shows , this is a factor 1000 more average current than in ctf ii , and also demonstrates the basic ability of the cathodes to produce the ctf 3 drive beam ( i=26@xmath10a ) . clic is still a factor 75 away . we are currently searching for ways to produce higher charges as well . measurements of qe against photon energy are routinely made after production and after use of photocathodes . we have demonstrated that both low energy and high energy responses agree well with spicer s theory . a gold buffer layer reduces the low energy response of cs - te cathodes . more work is needed to understand the measurements of the stoichiometric ratio of cs - te . coating with 2 nm csbr significantly decreased the quantum efficiency , without improving the storage lifetime . for the high - charge drive beam of clic , it is still necessary to demonstrate the capabilities of cs - te , for which first tests will be done soon . e. chevallay , j. durand , s. hutchins , g. suberlucq , m. wrgel , photocathodes tested in the dc gun of the cern photoemission laboratory \" , nuclear instruments methods in physics research section a , vol . 340 , ( 1994 ) 146 - 156 , cern clic note 203 e. shefer , a. breskin , r. chechik , a. buzulutskov , b.k . singh , m. prager , coated photocathodes for visible photon imaging with gaseous photomultipliers \" , nuclear instruments methods in physics research section a , vol.433 , no.1 - 2 , ( 1999 ) 502 - 506", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_276", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "in the ctf 换句话说 drive beam gun , cs - te photocathodes are used to produce a pulse train of 48 elect..."}
{"question": "上下文中的'一位名叫约翰的男士'指的是什么？", "answer": "John", "context": "New York, NY - January 15, 2014 - Today, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer announced that he has received a commitment that [隐藏] F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) will be assigned additional customs agents as the result of increased appropriations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill. This bill has boosted CBP’s funding by $165.7 million in order for the agency to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide. Specifically, the bill increases CBP’s overall budget to $10.6 billion, which is over $220 million more than FY2013. Schumer explained that $165.7 million of the new funding was explicitly prescribed “for the purpose of hiring, training, and equipping new U.S. customs and border protection offices.” During a confirmation hearing today, Schumer secured a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske, who is currently undergoing the confirmation process to be Commissioner of CBP, that he would commit to bringing an adequate portion of these new agents and resources to JFK once he has been confirmed. In September 2013, Schumer made an appeal to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement new measures that would help alleviate incredibly long lines for travelers using customs at JFK and he continued his push at a confirmation hearing today for Kerlikowske. Schumer’s appeal comes after a report revealed that customs lines at JFK Airport were among the longest wait times in the country. According to the report, the average delay during peak hours could be two hours or more. On July 1, 2013, at 6 am, the wait was 140 minutes. On August 3, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 120 minutes. On August 24, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 3 hours. Schumer has long advocated measures to decrease these wait times, including a personal call in September to then-Acting DHS Secretary Rand Beers, during which Schumer asked Beers to approve and install new automated Passport kiosks, as well as assign additional Custom and Border Patrol agents at JFK. Schumer also urged his colleagues to boost funding for the Customs and Border Protection in the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill, above the current 2013 levels and called current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to press his case. Today, Schumer announced that the recently released appropriations agreement called for $165.7 million to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide, and that he has received a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske that, when confirmed as Commissioner of CBP, he will assign an adequate portion of these new agents to JFK.

{"question": "上下文中的'一所位于美国的体育训练中心'指的是什么？", "answer": "Dunlap Athletic Training Facility", "context": "Former Florida State football players put their talents on display ahead of the upcoming NFL Draft. Florida State’s football program has churned out tons of professional talent in the past few years, boasting 33 players on NFL rosters at the beginning of the 2018 season. This year’s draft class looks to add to that number, as their talents were on full display for Thursday’s Pro Day at the [隐藏]. The ’Noles who turned out for the event participated in a series of strength and conditioning drills before splitting up to perform various exercises specific to their position, all with NFL scouts and coaches analyzing their mechanics and motions. For some, FSU’s Pro Day was little more than a formality, as was the case for defensive end Brian Burns. Currently projected to be taken in the first round of this year’s NFL Draft, Burns’ impressive performance at the NFL Combine left little for him to prove heading into the day’s events. As such, the six-foot-five defensive end opted to focus mainly on position drills, allowing NFL scouts to assess his mobility and ability to change direction in space. With the draft less than a month away, Burns has been in contact with the Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans. Following his drills, Burns spoke about how well both he and his teammates performed on the day as they prepare for the NFL Draft. For other players, such as defensive tackle Demarcus Christmas and wide receiver Nyqwan Murray, Pro Day was a chance to brush up on and perform better in drills that each struggled with at the NFL Combine. Hoping to perform better without all of the uncomfortable spotlight of the Combine, Christmas was satisfied with his Pro Day performance in a facility that former Seminoles like himself had previously practiced in and were familiar with. Christmas’ improvement on the 40-yard dash from a 5.08 at the NFL Combine to a 4.90 on Thursday solidified a successful outcome for him. However, it wasn’t smooth sailing for Murray unfortunately, as he pulled up during a position-specific catching drill clutching his hamstring and mouthing, “This isn’t me,” to assembled onlookers. The wide receiver’s Pro Day performance was certainly limited by his recent injury, as he was unable to run the 40-yard dash due to the pain. Murray also felt he could have done better running routes in position drills if it weren’t for his injured leg. On the other hand, defensive back A.J. Westbrook certainly made the most of his Pro Day, as he rode a fast start to an overall strong performance, literally. In the 40-yard dash, which was the first event of the day, the Daytona Beach, Florida native made scouts do a double take as he posted a 4.40 finish. Westbrook then translated that success to his positional drills, keeping the scouts’ eyes on him despite the fact that several NFL personnel in attendance were likely there to see other players first. In any case, Thursday’s Pro Day officially sealed the college careers of this year’s Florida State draft class. The Garnet & Gold will once again be well represented in the draft, with Burns projected to be a first-round pick, Christmas expected to be selected between the third and fifth rounds, and a slew of Seminoles likely to be taken after the fifth round.

{"question": "上下文中的'事实上'指的是什么？", "answer": "实际上", "context": "in a 1959 paper m. e. fisher introduced the general bond - decorated ising model as one example of a set of exactly solvable transformations of spin-1/2 ising models.@xcite a bond - decorated ising model has an `` arbitrary statistical mechanical system '' inserted in every original ising bond . the partition function of this decorated model is related to the partition function of the original or bare ising model by the addition of a prefactor and a renormalization of the coupling constants and magnetic moments ( the ising model is supposed to be in a parallel magnetic field).@xcite knowledge of the partition function of a given ising model thus allows one to obtain the partition function of any bond - decorated version of that ising model . more recently , streka and jaur have used the method of bond - decoration to investigate the thermodynamics of mixed ising - heisenberg chains in parallel magnetic fields where the decorating unit is a spin dimer or trimer with anisotropic heisenberg coupling ( see fig . [ 4:fig : isingheisenberg]).@xcite the partition function of these chains is readily obtained from the known partition function of the ising chain and the energy levels of the decorating unit . therefore , they could calculate exact magnetic properties and theoretically show , for example , the existence of magnetization plateaus in certain bond - alternating chains . the ising - heisenberg chain discussed in ref . ( showing only two unit cells ) . the bonds of the ising chain ( 1-@xmath2-@xmath3- ) are decorated with heisenberg dimers @xmath4(2 - 3 ) , ( @xmath5-@xmath6 ) , the partition function of this chain is exactly solvable . ] the convenience of the decorated ising chain as a theoretical model for spin chains derives from the relative ease with which exact solutions are obtained , in contrast for example with the pure heisenberg chain , for which no exact partition function has been found . up to now , this property of solvability has been the prime motive for the study of these chains in the literature . indeed , in ref . the decorated ising chain was considered as a substitute for the intractable heisenberg model , and in ref . the principle reason for introducing ising bonds to replace the more reasonable heisenberg bonds in a chain of cu^2+^ ions was the desire to obtain a solvable model . this approach can be applied to any type of heisenberg chain with a repeating unit : replace enough preferably ferromagnetic heisenberg bonds by ising bonds to obtain a decorated ising chain that is solved easily and , in some cases , exhibits thermodynamic properties that are qualitatively comparable with those of the original chain.@xcite however , the role of the decorated ising chain in the field of one - dimensional magnetism is not confined to that of a simplified model of realistic quantum spin chains . in this paper we show that some new molecular rings and chains are real examples of decorated ising systems . concretely , we treat a [ dycumocu ] infinite chain@xcite and a ( dycr)@xmath8 tetrameric ring.@xcite these compounds were recently synthesized in the course of the ongoing synthetic efforts to make new and better single - chain magnets ( scms ) and single - molecule magnets ( smms ) , whose characteristic property is a blocking or slow relaxation of magnetization at low temperatures . we will not be concerned here with these dynamical aspects of their magnetism , but only with their static magnetic properties . a necessary property of smms and scms is a magnetic anisotropy . one line of approach is to introduce anisotropy by means of lanthanide ions , whether or not in combination with transition metal ions.@xcite the two compounds considered here are products of this approach , with dysprosium as lanthanide ion . the dy@xmath9 ion plays a crucial role in these systems ; the nature of the ground state of this ion in its ligand environment determines whether the system is a decorated ising system or not and consequently , whether its partition function is exactly solvable or not . the ground kramers doublet of dy@xmath9 must have complete uniaxial magnetic anisotropy - factor of the kramers doublet is not zero ; for example @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ] and must be separated from excited kramers doublets by an amount that is large compared with the exchange coupling ( typically , this separation must be 100 @xmath12 or more).@xcite the required information on the ground and excited doublets of the dy@xmath9 monomer can be derived from _ ab initio _ calculations on the monomer complex , isolated from the polynuclear compound.@xcite the [ dycumocu ] chain and the ( dycr)@xmath8 ring are shown to be decorated ising chains in an arbitrarily directed magnetic field . the magnetic properties , in particular powder magnetization and susceptibility , are calculated with the help of the transfer - matrix method , which is a bit more general and convenient for numerical computation than the renormalization of the ising parameters , which was used by fisher and by streka and jaur . the results compare well with experiment and allow to determine values for the exchange coupling constants . the excited crystal field kramers doublets ( or stark levels ) of dy@xmath9 are not included in the decorated ising model . because of their relatively low energetic position , these kramers doublets can have a non - negligible contribution to the magnetic properties of the chain . we account for this in a first approximation by adding this contribution , as calculated _ ab initio _ for the monomeric dy@xmath9 complex , to the results of the decorated ising model . part of the decorated ising chain . in each ising bond is inserted an arbitrary statistical mechanical system@xcite , called decorating unit , that interacts only with the two ising spins @xmath13 at the vertices of the bond . the ising spin variables commute with the hamiltonian and have definite values in the eigenstates of the chain.,width=325 ] the decorated ising chain may be divided into units delimited by the ising spins , as in fig . [ 4:fig : decisingchain ] . the hamiltonian of the decorated ising chain ( or ring ) of length @xmath14 may accordingly be written as follows : @xmath15 where the subhamiltonians @xmath16 correspond to units of the chain . if the chain is closed into a ring , periodic boundary conditions apply by identifying the last with the first spin : @xmath17 . the ising spins @xmath13 commute with the subhamiltonians and the subhamiltonians commute with each other : @xmath18=0 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad [ \\hat{h}_i,\\hat{h}_j]=0.\\ ] ] it is further assumed that there is no direct interaction between the decorating units themselves , i.e. , two different @xmath16 have no variables in common , except for an @xmath13 when they are neighbors . in writing eq . ( [ 4:eq : hamdecising ] ) we made use of the fact that the ising spins are conserved variables and may be considered as parameters rather than operators . in the case of spin-1/2 , they take on the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , so that to each decorating unit there correspond four different subhamiltonians @xmath21 .. in fact , any parameter that takes on a finite number of values can serve as @xmath13 in eq . ( [ 4:eq : hamdecising ] ) . in practice however , @xmath13 represents most commonly a kramers doublet , which is most often described as an effective spin-1/2 . this is the case for the examples considered in this paper . ] since there is no direct interaction between the decorating units of the chain , the subhamiltonians @xmath16 in eq . ( [ 4:eq : hamdecising ] ) work for a given set of @xmath13 values on disjunct spaces . an eigenfunction of @xmath22 is then simply a direct product of @xmath14 independent eigenfunctions , one of each @xmath16 . the corresponding energy is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-th energy level of @xmath21 . following ref . we write the partition function of one decorating unit for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath26 on the bond vertices : @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 . the total partition function for the chain is then given by @xmath29 this is the well - known form of a transfer - matrix solution.@xcite each decorated bond ( or pair of neighboring ising spins ) is represented by a transfer matrix @xmath30 whose elements are the @xmath31 , the values of @xmath13 labeling the rows and the values of @xmath26 labeling the columns . explicitly for the spin-1/2 decorated ising chain : @xmath32 since most applications deal either with rings or very long chains , the boundaries can be identified ( @xmath17 ) and expression ( [ 4:eq : partitionfunction ] ) can be written as the trace of a matrix product : @xmath33 this is the most general expression for the partition function of a decorated ising chain . if the chain has translational symmetry the partition function is expressed in terms of eigenvalues.@xcite suppose that the chain is a repetition of identical decorated ising bonds , then the @xmath30 are all the same , so that @xmath34 where the @xmath35 are the eigenvalues of @xmath36 . according to perron s theorem on positive matrices , the eigenvalue @xmath37 with largest modulus is real , positive and nondegenerate.@xcite this yields the simple but exact result for the free energy per unit cell of the infinite chain : @xmath38 if a unit cell of the chain is spanned by @xmath39 decorated bonds instead of one then it is only necessary to combine @xmath39 transfer matrices into one new transfer matrix @xmath40 , with largest eigenvalue @xmath41 , to be used in eqs . ( [ 4:eq : partfunc_periodic ] ) and ( [ 4:eq : freenergy_infinite ] ) , where @xmath14 is to be replaced by @xmath42 . this situation arises , for example , when the local easy axes on the ising ions are not parallel but canted with respect to each other . the solution in terms of transfer matrices , eq . ( [ 4:eq : partfunc_transmatr ] ) , is not limited to decorated spin-1/2 ising chains . it is valid for chains having ising spins of any multiplicity or a combination of ising spins with different multiplicities , in which case the dimension of the transfer matrix is different from two by two . another advantage of the transfer matrix method is that it can be readily extended to include next - nearest - neighbor bonds between the ising spins . to this end , the transfer matrix has to be enlarged so that it does not jump from one ising spin to the next , but from one _ pair _ of ising spins to the next pair.@xcite we are interested in this paper in molecular chains or rings that can be described by a decorated ising model . this means that their low - energy spectrum can be modeled to satisfactory accuracy by an effective hamiltonian that has the properties described in section [ 4:sec : decising ] . it has been noted there that the composition of the decorating unit is basically arbitrary and we need therefore not consider the properties of that part . instead , our attention goes here to the molecular realization of the ising spin [ @xmath13 in eq . ] . we focus on because this ion is used in the two examples studied below , but the discussion applies equally well to several other trivalent lanthanides and also to some transition metal ions . it is known that lanthanide ions in a coordination environment are often well described by crystal field theory applied to the ground @xmath43 level . one assumes that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 remain good quantum numbers . is a kramers ion that belongs to the second half of the lanthanide series , whose ground level is ( @xmath47 ) , with associated land factor @xmath48 . this multiplet splits into eight kramers doublets by the crystal field perturbation ( except for high - symmetric environments belonging to the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 point groups , which split the multiplet in less than eight levels ) . it will be useful to view each kramers doublet as an effective spin-1/2 with its own @xmath1-factors ( 3 in number ) and corresponding magnetic axes . for example , take the kramers doublet @xmath52 ( of the level ) , quantized with respect to the @xmath53 axis . its @xmath1 factors are @xmath54 and @xmath10 . if the action of the crystal field on is such that the lowest kramers doublet is separated from the next one by an energy that is large compared to the energy of interaction with the magnetic field and the exchange interaction with neighboring ions , we can omit all excited kramers doublets from the hamiltonian and keep only the lowest doublet . in this way is described by a spin of 1/2 and every interaction in which it takes part enters the hamiltonian as a linear combination of the three spin operators @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . if we now want to be an ising spin , defined by the first commutation relation in eq . , it is clear that only one of these spin components , say @xmath57 or simply @xmath58 , may actually appear in the hamiltonian . in other words , there must be no interaction that creates an off - diagonal matrix element between the two components of the kramers doublet . this can be shown to be true with high accuracy if the lowest kramers doublet is @xmath52 . the two interactions of importance here are the zeeman interaction with the magnetic field and the exchange interaction with other magnetic ions . the zeeman hamiltonian follows directly from the @xmath1 factors of the kramers doublet ( vide supra ) , and is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath53 component of the applied magnetic field . note that the field may be applied in any direction , but it is only the @xmath53 component that interacts with the kramers doublet because @xmath10 . the vanishing of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in @xmath52 follows from the selection rule stating that a vector operator ( the magnetic moment in this case ) can not connect states for which @xmath63 differs by more than one unit . we will sometimes refer to the @xmath53 axis as the anisotropy axis , to stress that it is the only magnetic axis with nonvanishing @xmath1 factor . to evaluate the effect of exchange interaction , we must first take a closer look at the composition of the kramers doublet . in terms of the russel - saunders states @xmath64 we have @xmath65 in a basic ( super)exchange process between two magnetic centers , one electron of each center takes part . if we look at one center , the process removes an electron with certain spin projection ( up or down ) and puts it back on the center either with the same or with opposite spin projection.@xcite this gives rise to the selection rule @xmath66 . if the exchange interaction is to connect both components of the kramers doublet in eq . , at least five successive processes are needed , for @xmath67 . in other words , not one but five electron spins have to be flipped to connect @xmath68 with @xmath69 . if the basic exchange process ( i.e. the one for which @xmath70 ) occurs in , say , @xmath71th order of perturbation theory then an off - diagonal matrix element between the two components can only appear in @xmath72th order of perturbation theory . it is therefore reasonable to assume that the off - diagonal matrix element is negligibly small compared to the diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath73 ) so that the effect of exchange interaction on the kramers doublet is accurately described by the @xmath57 spin operator only . note that we derived the selection rule for exchange interaction on the basis of the spin quantum number @xmath74 only , without paying attention to the angular momentum quantum number @xmath75 , although @xmath75 changes even more than @xmath74 between the states of the kramers doublet . the existence and precise form of a selection rule for @xmath75 depends on the spatial symmetry of the exchange problem under consideration . @xmath76 is therefore not as useful as @xmath77 for predicting the vanishing of certain matrix elements of exchange interaction . note however that , even in the lowest symmetry , there is a maximum to the amount that @xmath75 can change in the basic exchange process described in the previous paragraph : within the @xmath78 orbitals , a one - electron process can bring about at most a change of @xmath79 . so we would have , in general , that a basic exchange process can induce the following changes in a lanthanide state : @xmath80 thus at least two steps of this kind are needed to bridge @xmath81 , but at least five are needed to bridge @xmath67 . so in this case , the selection rule of @xmath74 gives the stronger result and leads to the conclusions reached in the last paragraph on the matrix elements of exchange interaction in the kramers doublet . we can now derive the precise form of that part of the effective hamiltonian that refers to the exchange interaction between a ion [ with ground state ] and another magnetic center . we consider two cases , which we shall encounter in the examples in sections [ 4:sec : chain ] and [ 4:sec : ring ] : in the first case the other center is another ion ; in the second case the other center is an ion with an isotropic spin moment @xmath82 . consider first the exchange interaction with another ion . we assume that the second has the same property of uniaxiality as the first one and that it also shares all other relevant properties discussed in the previous paragraphs . then both ions are represented by a spin-1/2 doublet with a local anisotropy axis @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and we already know that the effect of exchange interaction in each doublet is proportional to @xmath85 . therefore the exchange hamiltonian is necessarily of the form @xmath86 where it is understood that the first spin belongs to ion 1 and the second to ion 2 . note that @xmath87 and @xmath88 need not be parallel with each other . as a second case , consider the interaction between ( anisotropy axis @xmath87 ) and an isotropic spin @xmath89 . the latter may typically be a transition metal ion with quenched orbital momentum . we found that the exchange processes that contribute do not change the spin projection on the ion ( @xmath90 , quantization axis @xmath87 ) , and that this result is independent of the exchange partner . it is also known that every exchange process commutes with the total spin ( the matrix elements involved are spin - independent matrix elements of kinetic , potential , and coulomb energy @xcite ) , so that @xmath91 . it follows then that @xmath92 , or , the exchange hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath93 component of @xmath89 . the simplest expression compatible with this requirement is @xmath94 where @xmath58 naturally represents and @xmath46 represents @xmath89 . the interaction is of ising form with the anisotropy axis of as ising axis . note that , when @xmath95 , higher powers of @xmath96 may enter the hamiltonian . considering exchange interaction as a perturbation however , one can usually assume that the lowest - order contribution , eq . , is the leading term . there are other cases conceivable , for example dipole - dipole interaction between the moment of and a neighboring moment . one will always find , as above , that the hamiltonian is a product of @xmath57 ( belonging to ) and a part that belongs to the other ion and whose form depends on the kind of the other ion and on the details of the interaction . we have now obtained that a ion , if its ground state is @xmath52 , fairly well separated from excited states , interacts with the magnetic field and with neighboring ions as an ising spin-1/2 , in the sense that the interaction is always proportional to @xmath57 , as expressed in the eqs . , , and . this means that a chain - like molecular structure having ions of this kind at regular positions in the chain would meet the requirements of a decorated ising chain , given in part by eqs . and . it remains of course to be shown that @xmath52 can indeed be the ground state of a coordinated ion in a polynuclear complex . at first sight , this seems rather unlikely . @xmath52 is an eigenstate of cylindrical symmetry . within lanthanide @xmath97 states , the crystal field is effectively cylindrical if there is , at least , an eightfold rotation axis ( @xmath98 ) or rotation - inversion axis ( @xmath99 ) . @xcite @xmath99 symmetry has been obtained , for example , in mononuclear bis(phtalocyaninato ) sandwich complexes of the lanthanides . @xcite even when such high symmetry is attained , the ground state is not necessarily the cylindrical doublet with highest @xmath100 value . @xcite apart from that , the symmetry of the coordination sphere of a lanthanide ion in a polynuclear , possibly heterometallic , complex or chain is usually much lower or even completely absent . such is the case for the two examples considered in this paper . on the basis of symmetry alone , there is thus no reason to expect @xmath52 to be an eigenstate , let alone the ground state . nevertheless , recent _ ab initio _ calculations have revealed the unexpected result that the ground state of several low - symmetry complexes of is very close to @xmath52 . @xcite they used the multiconfigurational , wavefunction - based casscf / rassi - so method , to obtain accurate wavefunctions for several of the lowest kramers doublets . calculation of the principal @xmath1 factors of these states gives an indication of their composition . it was found in several cases that the ground doublet has @xmath101 close to , but lower than 20 , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 close to 0 . this corresponds to a doublet mainly composed of @xmath52 . with evidence of _ ab initio _ calculations it is thus possible to identify in certain coordination environments as an ising spin-1/2 ( to a good approximation ) . we will use this information to identify the compounds in sections [ 4:sec : chain ] and [ 4:sec : ring ] as decorated ising chains ( or rings ) . to conclude this section we remark that one can not deduce from the vanishing of two @xmath1 factors alone that a kramers doublet will behave as an ising spin . it will , of course , in its interaction with the magnetic field [ eq . ] , but this will not , in general , be true for the exchange interaction . take again the example of , supposing the ground state is the kramers doublet @xmath102 . it is perfectly uniaxial because @xmath10 and @xmath103 . a closer look at the expansion of @xmath102 in terms of the russel - saunders states @xmath104 shows , however , that the selection rules in eq . permit a matrix element to exist between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , therefore introducing non - ising terms ( i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) in the same order of perturbation theory as the ising term in the exchange hamiltonian . there exists a similarity between the spectra of the decorated and undecorated ising chains at which we want to take a closer look here . we suppose infinite , periodic chains , or periodic , even - membered rings ( in odd - membered rings spin - frustration complicates the picture ) . we also limit ourselves to chains with ising spins of 1/2 . the undecorated , or simple , ising chain in a magnetic field @xmath107 parallel with the @xmath53 axis is given by eq . and @xmath108 where @xmath13 is the @xmath53 component of @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) . we [隐藏] , without loss of generality , @xmath111 . the eigenstates of the chain are spin _ configurations _ like ( @xmath112 ) , etc . of the @xmath113 eigenstates only two distinct ones can be the ground state : the ferromagnetic ( f ) and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) : @xmath114 when @xmath115 time - reversal symmetry makes every state degenerate with the state formed by flipping all the spins . this degeneracy is meant to be implied in , where only one of two states is shown in each case . only the two af states remain degenerate when @xmath116 . when @xmath117 a ground state level crossing occurs from af to f when @xmath107 is increased . at the point of crossing ( @xmath118 ) the two af states are degenerate together with all states derived from an af state by flipping one or more down - spins up . however , no other state than af or f can be the ground state at any other value of @xmath107 . thus the ground state of the ising chain is either f or af , and they are degenerate , together with an infinite number of other states , at the crossing point . we now decorate the ising bonds with identical but arbitrary units to obtain a periodic decorated ising chain . the spectrum is given by eq . . since the chain is periodic , the spectrum of the individual units @xmath16 is independent of @xmath119 and the energies may be written as @xmath120 , with @xmath71 ranging over the eigenstates of @xmath16 . there are four sets of @xmath120 : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , in an obvious notation . notice that the eigenstates of this chain can still be classified according to the configuration of the _ ising _ spins : ( @xmath112 ) etc . , which follows from the fact that all the @xmath13 and @xmath22 form a commuting set of observables . an interesting question is whether the same rules hold for the ground state of the decorated ising chain as did for the simple ising chain . the answer is yes ; the ground state is either f or af ( referring to the ising spin configuration ) and a crossing between them is possible , with the same number and kind of degenerate states as in the simple ising chain . to show this , we have to consider only the lowest eigenstate belonging to each of the @xmath113 possible ising spin configurations . in these states every unit is in its lowest possible state for the given orientation of the neighboring ising spins : @xmath125 ( we assume this energy to be nondegenerate ) , so that the total energy of the chain state is @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the number of pairs of neighboring ising spins that are both spin up , etc . for example , in the f configuration in eq . , @xmath128 ( periodic boundary conditions are assumed ) , while in the af configuration , @xmath129 . the eigenstates we have just described , with energy , are in an obvious one - to - one correspondence with the eigenstates of the simple ising chain . the ground state is found by minimizing with respect to the @xmath130 , under the restrictions @xmath131 the first relation states that the total number of ising spins ( or , equivalently , unit cells ) is @xmath14 . the second relation follows from the fact that , in a cyclic spin configuration , every @xmath132 pair must eventually be followed by a @xmath133 pair , possibly after a number of @xmath134 pairs . another restriction is that whenever both @xmath127 and @xmath135 are not zero , @xmath136 [ and by eq . also @xmath137 must be at least one . using we can rewrite eq . as @xmath138\\bigr)\\\\ & + n_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}\\bigl(\\varepsilon_1(\\downarrow\\downarrow)- \\frac{1}{2}[\\varepsilon_1(\\uparrow\\downarrow ) + \\varepsilon_1(\\downarrow\\uparrow)]\\bigr)\\\\ & + \\frac{n}{2 } [ \\varepsilon_1(\\uparrow\\downarrow)+\\varepsilon_1(\\downarrow\\uparrow ) ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we see that only the average @xmath139/2 $ ] of the `` antiparallel '' energies enters the equation . the last term is a constant and can be discarded for the purpose of relative energy considerations . we can now derive the values of @xmath127 and @xmath135 for the ground state of the chain , keeping in mind that @xmath125 is a function of the magnetic field @xmath140 . suppose then , first , that @xmath141 . time reversal symmetry asserts that @xmath142 and @xmath143 . it is simple to see that , depending on the relative ordering of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 is minimal in the f configuration ( @xmath128 or @xmath147 ; @xmath148 ) when @xmath149 or in the af configuration ( @xmath150 ; @xmath151 ) when @xmath152 ( we exclude the possibility of equality of both energies from the discussion ; @xmath153 would correspond , in the simple ising chain , with @xmath154 ) . when @xmath155 , time reversal symmetry is not operative , and we have , in general , four different energies @xmath125 . the equation shows that the configuration that minimizes @xmath146 is determined by the sign of the two terms in round brackets ; if both are positive , then @xmath150 ( af configuration ) ; if at least one of them is negative , then either @xmath128 or @xmath147 ( f configuration ) , depending on whether respectively @xmath144 or @xmath156 is lower . finally , the magnetic field can induce a transition from the af to an f ground state configuration , say with all ising spins up . this happens when @xmath157,\\ ] ] and @xmath158 . at this point , the ground state configurations are all those for which @xmath159 , exactly the same as in the simple ising chain . we find thus a complete analogy between the simple and the decorated ising chain as far as the ground state ising spin configuration is concerned . the only possible configurations are the fully antiferromagnetically aligned and the fully ferromagnetically aligned configurations . no `` intermediate '' configuration can be the ground state . the only exception is the crossing point between af and f , where there is a high degeneracy of configurations . these conclusions are independent of the nature of the decorating unit . although the decorated ising model predicts that the af and f ground states are both doubly degenerate ( in zero field ) , this degeneracy is not a result of the spatial symmetry : in the cyclic group @xmath160 , the two af components combine into irreducible representations ( irreps ) @xmath161 and @xmath107 , while the two f components transform as two @xmath161 irreps . introduction of neglected terms in the hamiltonian , that destroy the ising property , could split these ground state components . the decorated ising chain affords two new kinds of ground state level crossings , not present in the simple ising chain . the first of these is the transition between one f configuration of the ising spins and the other : @xmath162 . this transition takes place when @xmath142 . this level crossing , induced by the magnetic field , can for example be encountered in frustrated ising - heisenberg chains.@xcite a second kind of new ground state transition arises from the crossing of levels _ within _ a decorating unit . a ground state crossing can result in which the ising spin configuration remains the same but the state corresponding to @xmath125 crosses with the state corresponding to @xmath163 . more precisely this happens in the f configuration when @xmath164 and in the af configuration when either @xmath165 or @xmath166 , or both . the previous paragraphs have shown that we do not need to consider configurations other than f and af for the ground state . level crossings are usually connected with the presence of good quantum numbers . for the ising - type crossings , the relevant conserved quantities are the @xmath14 ising spins @xmath167 . the crossing of energy levels within the decorating unit should be associated with a conserved variable that is _ internal _ to that unit , much the same as in isolated molecules . in section [ 4:sec : chain ] we will encounter an example where both transitions ising type and internal type occur in a magnetic field . in the following sections we will be comparing our theoretical results with measurements performed on powder samples of the crystalline compounds . in this section we consider the powder averaging of magnetization for the example of the simple ising chain . let @xmath168 and @xmath169 be the polar angles of the magnetic field vector with respect to a molecular reference frame , then the free energy is a function of @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and the strength of the field , @xmath107 : @xmath170 . the projection of the magnetization on the field direction @xmath171 is @xmath172 averaging over one hemisphere gives the powder magnetization @xmath173 let us see how the powder averaging affects the magnetization curve for a simple ising chain . take a spin-1/2 infinite antiferromagnetic ising chain with anisotropy axes parallel with each other and with the @xmath53 axis , and uniaxial @xmath1-factors ( @xmath10 and @xmath174 ) . this could for example be realized by a chain of identical units ( see section [ 4:sec : dy ] ) . the hamiltonian is given by eq . , substituting @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the @xmath53 component of the magnetic field , and @xmath117 . defining @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the magnetization , which has only a nonzero @xmath53 component , is@xcite @xmath179}{\\sqrt{\\sinh^2[b\\cos\\theta/2t]+e^{-j / t}}}.\\ ] ] the projection on the field direction [ eq . ] is @xmath180 . plugging this in eq . and substituting @xmath181 yields the powder magnetization of the ising chain @xmath182}{\\sqrt{\\sinh^2[b u/2t]+e^{-j / t}}}u\\,du.\\ ] ] because the hamiltonian in eq . does not depend on @xmath169 , this variable has been integrated out in eq . . ] ] figs . [ 4:fig : magnising_zas ] and [ 4:fig : magnising_powder ] show plots of magnetization versus magnetic field , for coupling constant @xmath183 . the step - like appearance of @xmath184 is associated with the ground state crossing that occurs at @xmath185 . at that point , the antiferromagnetic ground state ( or rather ground state ising doublet ) is replaced by the ferromagnetic state ( all spins up ) . consequently , the magnetization jumps from zero to the saturation value of 0.5 , as seen in fig . [ 4:fig : magnising_zas ] . the magnetization of a powder sample of the same ising chain is shown in fig . [ 4:fig : magnising_powder ] . before the crossing point , @xmath186 behaves qualitatively the same as @xmath184 . after the crossing point however , @xmath186 is seen to reach only slowly its saturation value , which is half of the saturation value of @xmath184 , viz . the limiting curve of @xmath186 as @xmath187 can be calculated exactly from eq . : @xmath188 ( this is of course only valid for the antiferromagnetic case @xmath189 . ) in fig . [ 4:fig : magnising_powder ] , this limiting curve is very closely approximated by the curve at @xmath190 . clearly , the sharp step of @xmath184 transforms in the powder to the concave form displayed by @xmath186 . this is understood from the fact that , in a powder , for a given field @xmath191 , there is always a fraction of molecules that is not magnetized ( in the sense that they are in the antiferromagnetic ground state ) because they are oriented so with respect to the field , that @xmath192 ( see fig . [ 4:fig : magnising_zas ] ) . the powder saturates only when every molecule is fully magnetized , and this happens only for @xmath193 . therefore , @xmath186 ( at @xmath194 ) does not abruptly saturate at the crossover point , but increases slowly to saturation . in deriving the exchange hamiltonian in section [ 4:sec : dy ] we assumed that only the lowest kramers doublet on took part . this is certainly a good approximation when the gap between the lowest and the second - lowest kramers doublet is much larger then the strength of the exchange interaction . however , the excited kramers doublets often have to be taken into account to a certain degree of approximation if a comparison with experimental data on susceptibility and magnetization is desired . the crystal field splitting of the level is of the order of @xmath195 at room temperature . this gives rise to two effects : ( i ) a thermal population of excited kramers doublets , and ( ii ) a modification of the lowest kramers doublet as a function of the applied magnetic field by interaction with the excited doublets . effect ( i ) is mainly visible in the temperature dependence of @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the powder magnetic susceptibility : for a single center , @xmath196 increases monotonically with increasing temperature , from the value of the ground doublet at 0 k to the saturation value of at higher temperatures . effect ( ii ) gives rise to temperature - independent paramagnetism ( tip ) . it is visible at temperatures sufficiently low so that only the ground doublet is occupied . it contributes a linear increase of @xmath196 with @xmath49 and a linear increase of the magnetization @xmath186 with the applied field @xmath107 . in the simplest approximation , the contribution of the excited kramers doublets to the magnetic properties of the chain is equal to the contribution they have to the properties of the single , isolated ion in the same ligand environment it has in the chain . let @xmath198 and @xmath199 denote susceptibility and magnetization derived from the decorated ising chain model , and let @xmath200 denote the susceptibility of the center and @xmath201 the magnetic moment induced by @xmath107 in the ground doublet of the center , then the corrected properties are ( supposing one ion per unit cell ) [ 4:eq : corrections ] @xmath202 the last equation assumes that only the ground doublet of is occupied . this is correct at the temperature at which magnetization curves are usually recorded ( e.g. , 2@xmath203 ) . if necessary , corrections due to other magnetic ions can be added in the same way . @xmath200 and @xmath204 can be obtained from multiconfigurational _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite , or , in oligonuclear complexes , experimentally by replacing certain magnetic ions with diamagnetic ions.@xcite the equations are evidently correct in the limit of vanishing exchange interactions . the assumption we make is that the exchange interactions are sufficiently small for these corrections to remain valid . a more accurate approach should take into consideration the fact that the excited kramers doublets also participate in the exchange interaction with neighbors . this is however out of the scope of the decorated ising model . we now turn our attention to two actual examples of decorated ising models based on : a chain , treated in this section , and a four - ring treated in the following section . the problem is approached as follows : the hamiltonian for the chain in a magnetic field is formulated , with the help of the considerations in section [ 4:sec : dy ] . values of the @xmath1 factors of the magnetic ions are taken directly from _ ab initio _ calculations , reported elsewhere.@xcite this leaves the exchange coupling constants as parameters of the model , to be fitted by comparison with experimental magnetization and susceptibility data . ( in section [ 4:sec : ring ] , the direction of the anisotropy axis contributes one extra parameter . ) @xmath0 chain , showing type of exchange interactions and labeling of exchange constants . see ref . for the complete molecular structure.[4:fig : chainscheme ] ] the [ dycumocu ] chain was recently synthesized and details of its chemical composition and structure are given in ref . . the crystal structure was found to consist of parallel linear chains each made of [ dycumocu ] unit cells . [ 4:fig : chainscheme ] shows how the metal ions are connected by ligand bridges . multiconfigurational casscf / rassi - so calculations have been performed on each of the four metal ions in their ligand environment , suitably disconnected from the rest of the chain ( details of the calculations can be found in ref . and the accompanying supplementary information ) . most important for us is that the center was found to have a ground kramers doublet , separated by 141 @xmath12 from the second doublet , and characterized by complete uniaxial anisotropy : @xmath205 ( actually @xmath61 and @xmath62 were calculated about 0.03 , which is small enough to be ignored . ) the value of @xmath206 shows that this doublet is only slightly perturbed from the @xmath52 doublet of the level , the latter having @xmath207 . together with the fact that the energy gap to the second kramers doublet is about ten times larger than the exchange interaction ( as we will find later ) , these results indicate that the ion will behave as an ising spin , as described in section [ 4:sec : dy ] . as a side - note we may add that the total splitting of the level was calculated to be 560 @xmath12 , which is indeed of the order of room - temperature @xmath195 ( see section [ 4:sec : corrections ] ) . both ( @xmath208 ) and ( @xmath209 ) have a spin = 1/2 , orbitally nondegenerate ground state , well separated ( @xmath210 ) from higher states . the two ions in the unit cell reside in almost identical environments@xcite and have therefore virtually the same properties . the calculated @xmath1 factors are tetragonal : @xmath211 for and @xmath212 for . to avoid unnecessary complications we will regard these ions as isotropic spins with root - mean - square @xmath1 factors @xmath213 this approximation will not have important consequences for the magnetic properties , which are largely dominated by the high moment anyway . we introduce exchange interaction between metal ions directly connected by ligand bridges . interacts with its three neighbors via the ising hamiltonian eq . . interaction between the isotropic spins is given by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath214 .

( the least - squares fit of @xmath197 gave @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 . ) there are , as far as we know , no data in the literature with which to compare the values in eq . . however , an experimental study is available of a ( , ) dinuclear complex in which the bridging ligand is the same as in this chain.@xcite the authors found a ferromagnetic interaction . a superficial analysis of the susceptibility curve in that paper , using the ising hamiltonian we use in this paper , yields @xmath238 . the other values in are difficult to assess . for a discussion of these values and their relation with the molecular structure as well as some evidence from dft calculations , we refer to ref . . certainly , no confidence should be attached to the numbers in decimal places in . the correction refers to the contribution of excited kramers doublets , eq . . ] the effect of the excited kramers doublets of is most clearly seen in the @xmath196 curve ( fig . [ 4:fig : chainchitp ] ) . the curve shows a steady increase above 50@xmath203 which is not predicted by our decorated ising model , but is indeed due to the thermal population of the kramers doublets that originate from the level . we can obtain the expected high - temperature limit of @xmath196 by considering the metal ions as independent spins . the susceptibility components @xmath239 of an angular momentum multiplet @xmath44 with principal @xmath1-factors @xmath240 ( @xmath241 ) are given by @xcite @xmath242 summing over ( , @xmath243 ) , , , and ( all are isotropic ) gives @xmath244 a similar calculation , only including the lowest kramers doublet of , with @xmath1-factors as in eq . , gives 13.2@xmath245 . the correction supplied by the _ ab initio _ calculations to account for this difference , is seen to cover nicely the high - temperature part of the experimental curve . one notices that @xmath196 shows a slight depression around 40@xmath203 which is not entirely reproduced by the theory . this might indicate a failure of the simple approximation we used to include the excited kramers doublets . eq . is certainly correct at very high temperatures , when the exchange interactions are irrelevant , and at very low temperatures , when the excited kramers doublets are not occupied . if these two regions do not overlap , however , there is a temperature window between , in which excited doublets start to get occupied while exchange interaction is not quite negligible yet . in that case , the exchange interaction of the occupied excited doublet(s ) with other ions should be taken into account . such an interaction of antiferromagnetic type could possibly depress @xmath196 as observed . we shall now describe some features of the spectrum of the chain , paying attention to the properties described in section [ 4:sec : eigenstates ] . consider the chain without magnetic field . the exchange parameters in eq . predict a ground state that has an af ising spin configuration . this is in accordance with the susceptibility measurements , which show that @xmath246 as @xmath247 , requiring a nonmagnetic ground state ( fig . [ 4:fig : chainchitp ] ) . the ground state is indeed nonmagnetic because @xmath248 is the time - reversed state of @xmath249 . let @xmath74 denote an eigenvalue of @xmath250 [ eq . ] : @xmath251 . @xmath252 is conserved so @xmath74 may be used to label the eigenstates @xmath253 ( we may leave out the index @xmath119 because all units of the chain are identical ) . for the ground state , we find @xmath254 in @xmath248 and @xmath255 in @xmath249 . the powder magnetization ( see also fig . [ 4:fig : chainmp ] ) is compared with the projections of @xmath256 on the field direction [ eq . ] , for three different directions of the field ; @xmath168 is the angle between @xmath140 and the @xmath53 axis . ] same as fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponents ] but at lower temperature and to higher field . ] [ eq . ] in a magnetic field _ parallel _ with the @xmath53 axis ( @xmath257 ) . circles indicate ground state level crossings . the ground state of the chain is af in zero field ( left ) , switches to f at 0.64@xmath258 , and undergoes an internal level crossing at 6.3@xmath258 , marked by a change of the internal quantum number @xmath74 from 1/2 to 3/2 . both crossings can be seen in the @xmath257 magnetization curve in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponentslowt ] . note that the energy curves appear as straight lines , although , with the exception of @xmath259 , they are not exactly straight , because the zeeman hamiltonian does not _ completely _ commute with the total hamiltonian . all @xmath121 decrease with increasing field strength because the large magnetic moment of dominates the smaller magnetic moments of the decorating unit . ] since the ground state is af , we might expect that in a magnetic field a crossover will occur to an f ground state . this is indeed what happens . the convex increase of @xmath186 in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmp ] points to a flip of the spins to a parallel configuration . this is inferred from the value of the magnetization , which approaches 6@xmath260 at 5@xmath258 . the [ cumocu ] unit alone can only contribute a maximum of @xmath261 . the strong increase must come from the contribution of the large moments . the behavior of magnetization along certain directions of applied field is shown in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponents ] . the af @xmath262 f transition is most clearly seen when the field is applied along @xmath53 ( @xmath257 ) ; the transition occurs below 1@xmath258 . after 1@xmath258 , @xmath184 reaches an approximately constant plateau at @xmath263 . the saturation value of magnetization in direction @xmath264 is @xmath265 . this gives @xmath266 for @xmath257 , which shows that @xmath184 has not quite reached its maximum at 5@xmath258 yet . the positions of level crossings become more sharply defined on lowering the temperature ( fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponentslowt ] ) . here we also see that @xmath184 undergoes a second transition at 6.3@xmath258 , after which it reaches saturation . this transition is connected with a level crossing _ in _ the [ cumocu ] unit ( see section [ 4:sec : eigenstates ] ) from @xmath255 to @xmath267 , as opposed to the first transition , at 0.64@xmath258 , which is of the ising type , described by eq . . the latter is the analogue of the transition in the af simple ising chain ( fig . [ 4:fig : magnising_zas ] ) , while the `` internal '' transition has no such analogue but is unique to the decorated ising chain . the relevant energy level diagram is shown in fig . [ 4:fig : chainlevelcrossings ] . note that , for fields not parallel to @xmath53 ( for example , @xmath268 in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponentslowt ] ) , @xmath74 is not a quantum number and the internal level crossing turns into an avoided crossing . this does not apply for the ising level crossing because the ising spins are always conserved . only when the field is applied perpendicular to @xmath53 ( @xmath269 in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponentslowt ] ) does the af @xmath262 f transition not occur because the spins do not interact with perpendicular fields . @xmath0 , without correction for contribution of excited kramers doublets . the powder @xmath196 ( see also fig . [ 4:fig : chainchitp ] ) is compared with the cartesian components of @xmath270 . @xmath53 is the direction of the anisotropy axis of , @xmath271 is any direction perpendicular to @xmath53 . @xmath272 . ] the low - temperature limit of the powder magnetization in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponentslowt ] may be compared with that of the simple ising chain in fig . [ 4:fig : magnising_powder ] . the resemblance is clear ; the decorated chain is different in the small linear increase of @xmath186 before the transition , and the more linear approach to saturation , which lies at ( @xmath273 . both are due to tip interaction in the [ cumocu ] unit , the effect of which is most clearly seen in the @xmath274 curve in fig . [ 4:fig : chainmcomponentslowt ] . to conclude this section we remark that the mentioned similarity with the magnetization of the simple ising chain is a consequence of the very high magnetic moment of the spins in comparison with the [ cumocu ] unit . the dominance of is most dramatically shown in the components of @xmath196 ( fig . [ 4:fig : chainchitcomponents ] ) . an application of eq . shows that the high - temperature limit of @xmath275 is @xmath276 , while that of @xmath277 is @xmath278 . cr@xmath8 molecule indicating numbering of atoms and exchange coupling constants . the boxes show the orientation of the local anisotropy axes on dy sites , when viewed from the poles of the @xmath279 and @xmath280 axes . the @xmath281 axis points out of the center of the scheme.,width=325 ] as a second example we describe in this section the application of the decorated ising model to a ring - shaped molecule.@xcite dy@xmath8cr@xmath8 consists of alternating and ions forming a closed ring . the four ions lie in a plane . the ions are positioned alternatingly above and below this plane , `` decorating '' the dy - dy bonds . the molecule has @xmath282 symmetry , the ions lying on @xmath283 axes and the ions lying on the mirror planes . we choose a molecular reference frame @xmath284 so that @xmath281 coincides with the @xmath285 axis and @xmath279 and @xmath280 coincide with the two @xmath283 axes of @xmath282 ( fig . [ 4:fig : ringscheme ] ) . _ ab initio _ calculations have been performed in the same way as for the [ dycumocu ] chain.@xcite from these , we take again the @xmath1-factors of the ground doublet of and of the isotropic ground state spin multiplet of ( @xmath286 , @xmath287 ) : @xmath288 the kramers doublet is again very close to the @xmath289 state , permitting the use of the ising model . however , the same calculation predicted the second kramers doublet at 30@xmath290 , not very high compared with exchange interaction , which we found in the previous section @xmath291 . this should be seen as a warning that our treatment of the excited kramers doublets as `` innocent '' may not be entirely correct here , and thus may lead to discrepancies with experiment . in this respect we must also note that , for such small excitation energies , the results of the _ ab initio _ calculations are not always conclusive on the nature of the ground state kramers doublet . in the present case , for instance , another set of calculations produced a ground state kramers doublet on that is not uniaxial as in eq . , having relatively large transversal @xmath1-factors.@xcite the decorated ising model would be unusable in this case . we find however that , assuming the axial g - factors in eq . , is an interesting example of a decorated ising ring , for which qualitative agreement with experimental magnetic properties can be obtained . direct ligand bridges connect each with two neighboring ions and two neighboring ions . exchange interaction between these pairs is introduced [ eqs and ] . the hamiltonian is then given by eq . : @xmath292 , and @xmath293 where @xmath294 denotes the ising spin-1/2 variable on dy@xmath295 and @xmath296 denotes the projection of the spin of cr@xmath295 on the magnetic anisotropy axis of dy@xmath295 ( for numbering , see fig [ 4:fig : ringscheme ] ) . similarly , @xmath297 is the projection of the magnetic field on the anisotropy axis of dy@xmath295 . @xmath221 is the @xmath101 factor of [ eq . ] . an interesting difference with the [ dycumocu ] chain is that here , in , the four anisotropy axes @xmath298 are not , in general , parallel , a result of point symmetry instead of translational symmetry . the orientation of the local anisotropy axis on , being one of the @xmath1-tensor main axes , is restricted by the local @xmath283 symmetry to be either parallel with , or orthogonal to the local @xmath283 axis . the first possibility can be excluded on the basis of the experiment ; with the @xmath298 pointing radially outwards at each dy@xmath295 , the ground state of the whole molecule is necessarily nonmagnetic , because the local moments add up to zero , independent of whether the ground state is f or af with respect to the ising spins . the experimental susceptibility measurement however indicates a magnetic ground state ( nonzero intercept on the vertical axis in fig . [ 4:fig : ringchitp ] ) . we must therefore choose the second case and let the anisotropy axis on each dy be orthogonal to the local @xmath283 axis and make an angle of @xmath299 with the molecular @xmath281-axis ( see fig . [ 4:fig : ringscheme ] ) . by applying the symmetry elements of @xmath282 to one of these anisotropy axes , one obtains the other three . when @xmath300 the four axes are parallel and point in the same direction as @xmath281 . we note that the _ ab initio _ calculations yielded @xmath301 . we will need some flexibility in our model however , so we leave @xmath299 as a parameter that will be determined from comparison with experiment . in terms of the molecular coordinate system , the projections on the local anisotropy axes are a function of @xmath299 : @xmath302 the same relations hold for the magnetic field , after replacing @xmath303 by @xmath107 . the fact that only exchange interactions of ising type appear in eq . makes it possible to find analytical solutions of the eigenvalues and the partition function . from eqs . and we see that the part of @xmath16 that involves @xmath303 is a projection of @xmath304 on the vector @xmath305 where @xmath83 is the unit vector along the anisotropy axis of dy@xmath295 ( the superscripts @xmath298 on @xmath13 are left out from now on ) . the vector defines the quantization axis of @xmath304 , which depends on the states on the neighboring sites ( @xmath13 , @xmath26 ) . the stronger the coupling ( @xmath217 ) with dy , the stronger will be the deviation of the quantization axis from the direction of @xmath140 . the eigenvalues of @xmath16 are then @xmath306 where @xmath307 , and @xmath308 is the length of the vector in eq . . some remarks should be made on the solutions . eqs . and ( replace @xmath303 by @xmath107 ) show that the spectrum in eq . is not the same for every unit @xmath119 , as it was in the [ dycumocu ] chain , unless @xmath140 is applied along the @xmath281 axis . this means that also the transfer matrices @xmath30 will be different and that we have to use eq . instead of eq . for the partition function . a second remark concerns the quantum number @xmath74 . the lowest energy in eq . is always given by @xmath309 , but note that the axis to which this quantization refers is not invariant ; in particular , it changes with strength and direction of applied field , so that @xmath74 does not represent a real conserved quantity that could be responsible for level crossings of the `` internal '' type . such crossings do not occur in . we conclude the solution by finding the partition function @xmath310 . substituting eq . in eq . we find @xmath311}{\\sinh [ \\beta b_i/2]}\\\\ & \\quad \\times \\exp[\\beta(j_2 s_is_{i+1 } + \\mu_\\mathrm{b } g_\\mathrm{dy } s_i b^{z_i})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 as defined in eq . , we obtain the partition function @xmath312 let us now compare the theoretical results with experiment . a great amount of information on the values of the parameters @xmath299 , @xmath217 and @xmath313 can be obtained by inspection of the powder @xmath196 curve ( fig . [ 4:fig : ringchitp ] ) . the nonzero intercept @xmath314 indicates a magnetic ground state.@xcite now from the general theory we know that the ground state is either f ( @xmath315 ) or af ( @xmath316 ) with respect to the spins ; for a periodic ring or chain , is valid here because we are considering the eigenstates of in the _ absence _ of magnetic field , in which case the ring is effectively cyclic symmetric . ] af is nonmagnetic so we decide that the ground state must be f. incidentally , we can precisely delineate the regions in parameter space where the ground state is f or af : [ 4:eq : ring_groundstates ] @xmath317 a second piece of information comes from the increase of @xmath196 with increasing temperature . this is partly but not completely due to the occupation of excited kramers doublets , as one can show by subtracting the contribution of the latter , obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculations ( not shown here ) . there must still be an antiferromagnetic interaction to explain the increase . since the are already known to be ferromagnetically aligned , the only possibility is that the spins couple antiferromagnetically with , or @xmath318 . with this information , we can determine the angle @xmath299 . at 0@xmath203 , @xmath196 is determined by the magnetic moment in the ground state only.@xcite in the f ( @xmath315 ) state , @xmath319 by symmetry and @xmath320 so @xmath321 . with the help of eqs . and the fact that , in the ground state , @xmath309 in eq . , we can evaluate eq . to find @xmath322 this is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath299 that can be used to derive @xmath299 from the experimental value @xmath323 , and the knowledge that @xmath324 . this gives @xmath325 . we derive values for @xmath217 , @xmath313 , and @xmath299 by a least - squares fitting of @xmath197 . as before , a correction for the contribution of excited kramers doublets is provided by the _ ab initio _ calculations and applied following eq . . the fitting yields @xmath326 the comparison with experiment is shown in figs . [ 4:fig : ringchitp ] and [ 4:fig : ringmp ] . note that the magnetic properties are reported per mole ( @xmath197 and @xmath196 ) or per molecule ( @xmath186 ) of and not per dycr unit . note also that @xmath324 , that @xmath313 satisfies eq . , and that @xmath299 agrees with the value derived above . has been added to the theoretical curve , according to eq . . ] the agreement of magnetization curves ( fig . [ 4:fig : ringmp ] ) is not as good as it was for the [ dycumocu]@xmath0 chain , although the qualitative properties seem to correspond . in particular , we mention the strong linear increase of @xmath186 at higher fields ( @xmath327 ) , which is due to the gradual orientation of the spins to the magnetic field [ see discussion connected with eq . ] , and , to a smaller extent , also to the correction of 0.5@xmath232 , a non - negligible linear contribution to magnetization , which is due to the low - lying excited kramers doublets . as was mentioned before , the discrepancies are not unexpected given a low - lying first excited kramers doublet of , which could undermine the assumptions underlying the decorated ising model . note also that we could not take the _ ab initio _ value of 37@xmath328 for @xmath299 . leaving @xmath299 as a parameter can be seen as a partial compensation for the inaccuracies of the model and the _ ab initio _ results . we have shown that the decorated ising model is a valid model for the magnetic properties of certain lanthanide - containing magnetic compounds , if the crystal field spectrum of the lanthanide ion satisfies certain properties . the most important of these is the requirement of a ground state kramers doublet with completely uniaxial magnetic anisotropy ( this statement is simplified , see section [ 4:sec : dy ] for the correct details ) . it is a remarkable fact that precisely this property has been established by multiconfigurational _ ab initio _ calculations on several centers that are part of polynuclear molecular magnets . perhaps the best known example is the triangle , where the ising properties of were used to explain the nature of the ground state.@xcite we have focused on as lanthanide ion because this is a much - used lanthanide in current synthetic research in molecular magnetism ( witness both compounds in this paper ) and because computational results showing that it meets the requirements for an ising spin are available . however , there is no reason to assume that the findings are unique to . we expect that other lanthanides with high momentum ( e.g. , ) will exhibit the same uniaxial anisotropy in certain ligand environments and that examples of decorated ising chains based on lanthanides other than will be found in the future . we thank liviu ungur for providing results of the _ ab initio _ calculations . we thank the referee for useful suggestions and comments . w. v.d.h . acknowledges financial support from the research foundation - flanders ( fwo ) .", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_298", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "in a 1959 paper m. e. fisher introduced the general bond - decorated ising model as one example of a..."}

category @xmath457 of @xmath453 with objects elements of @xmath383 and arrows @xmath451 such that there exists a borel function @xmath159 with @xmath458 , is a groupoid . let @xmath245 be a normed groupoid with a separable norm . a deformation of @xmath245 is basically a `` local action '' of a commutative group @xmath459 on @xmath1 which satisfies several properties . @xmath460 is a commutative group endowed with a group morphism @xmath461 to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers . this morphism induces a invariant topological filter over @xmath459 ( a end of @xmath459 ) . further we shall write @xmath462 for @xmath353 converging to this end , and meaning that @xmath463 . the neutral element of @xmath459 is denoted by @xmath322 . to any @xmath199 is associated a transformation @xmath464 , which may be called a dilatation , dilation , homothety or contraction . for the precise properties of the domains and codomains of @xmath465 for @xmath199 see the subsection [ bordet ] . for the moment is sufficient to know that for any @xmath199 we have @xmath466 and @xmath467 . basically the domain and codomain of @xmath465 are neighbourhoods of @xmath0 . moreover , these sets are chosen so that various compositions of transformations @xmath465 are well defined . in the formulation of properties of deformations we shall use a uniform convergence on bounded sets . we explain further what uniform convergence on bounded sets means in the case of nets of functions indexed with the directed net the group @xmath459 ( ordered such that limits are taken in the sense @xmath468 . a * dilation of a separated normed groupoid * @xmath245 is a map assigning to any @xmath199 a transformation @xmath469 which satisfies the following : 1 . for any @xmath199 @xmath470 . moreover @xmath471 is an action of @xmath459 on @xmath1 , that is for any @xmath472 we have @xmath473 , @xmath474 and @xmath475 . 2 . for any @xmath86 and any @xmath199 we have @xmath476 . moreover the transformation @xmath477 contracts @xmath478 to @xmath105 uniformly on bounded sets , which means that the net @xmath479 converges to the constant function @xmath480 , uniformly on bounded sets , in the sense of definition [ defcon ] . moreover the domains and codomains @xmath478 , @xmath481 satisfy the conditions from definition [ dax0 ] , section [ bordet ] . a * dilation of a separated normed or seminormed category * is defined in the same way as a dilation of a normed groupoid , only that @xmath90 and @xmath97 functions are no longer the source and arrow functions , but @xmath482 and @xmath483 . [ ddefor ] the dilation @xmath484 of @xmath245 induces a right - invariant dilation of the normed groupoid @xmath485 . the proof of the following proposition is straightforward and we do not write it . for any @xmath199 we define @xmath486 on @xmath487 , given by : @xmath488 this is a deformation of the normed groupoid @xmath489 is a normed groupoid and moreover @xmath78 is a morphism of normed groupoids ( that is a norm preserving morphism of groupoids ) , which commutes with dilations in the sense : for any @xmath490 @xmath491 . [ pdefindd ] let @xmath492 and @xmath493 be two dilations of the normed groupoids @xmath494 , @xmath495 respectively . then @xmath496 is a morphism of dilations if : @xmath53 is a morphism of groupoids , it preserves the norms ( it is a isometry ) and it commutes with dilations ( it is `` * linear * '' ) . dilations are locally defined . this is explained in the following definition , which should be seen as the axiom a0 of dilations . the domains and codomains of a dilation of @xmath245 satisfy the following axiom a0 : 1 . for any @xmath199 @xmath466 and @xmath497 , 2 . for any bounded set @xmath498 there are @xmath499 such that for any @xmath199 , @xmath500 : @xmath501 @xmath502 3 . for any bounded set @xmath498 there are @xmath503 and @xmath504 $ ] such that for any @xmath199 , @xmath505 and any @xmath506 we have : @xmath507 [ dax0 ] concerning ( iii ) definition [ dax0 ] , the first part of a1 definition [ ddefor ] implies that @xmath508 is well defined for any @xmath509 such that @xmath510 . the purpose of this section is to define several deformations of normed groupoids , such that the diagram from figure [ figure2 ] becomes a commutative diagram of morphisms of dilations . let us consider a triple @xmath511 with @xmath245 a normed groupoid and @xmath484 a dilation . for any @xmath512 there are two normed induced groupoids , such that the arrows in the diagram ( [ figure2 ] ) are morphisms . as dilatations are not globally defined and they are used to transport groupoid operations , it follows that the transported objects ( operation , norms , ... ) are not globally defined . therefore the induced groupoids are not groupoids , but `` local '' groupoids , in a sense which is clear in the context . [ rkdom ] the deformation @xmath513 is equal to @xmath1 as a set and its operations , norm and dilation are transported by the map @xmath514 ( with the precautions concerning the domains of definition of the transported objects mentioned in remark [ rkdom ] ) . the deformation @xmath515 is equal to @xmath91 as a groupoid and its norm and dilation are transported by the map @xmath516 . [ defdia ] more precisely , the deformation @xmath513 is described by : 1 . @xmath517 as a set , @xmath518 and @xmath519 , which follow from the computations using a1 , a2 definition [ ddefor ] : @xmath520 also @xmath521 . the composition operation and inverse are @xmath522 these are well defined ( at least locally ) because of the axiom a0 definition [ dax0 ] . notice that @xmath523 from the diagram [ figure2 ] appears as the difference function associated with the operation @xmath524 , defined as @xmath525 3 . the norm @xmath526 is defined as : @xmath527 4 . we may transport the dilation @xmath484 of @xmath245 into a dilation @xmath528 of @xmath529 , but from the commutativity of @xmath459 we get that @xmath530 therefore it is the same dilation . the deformation @xmath515 is described by : 1 . @xmath531 as a groupoid ; remark that this is compatible with the transport of operations using the map @xmath532 ( because this map is an endomorphism of the groupoid @xmath91 ) , 2 . with respect to the relation ( [ dfird ] ) , notice that @xmath533 and @xmath523 as represented in figure [ figure2 ] is a morphism of groupoids , 3 . the norm @xmath534 is defined as : @xmath535 and it is easy to check that @xmath523 is also a isometry . we transport the dilation @xmath536 of @xmath537 into a dilation @xmath538 @xmath539 the commutativity of the diagram [ figure2 ] is clear now . at the core of the introduction of dilations lies the fact that we can construct group operations from them . more precisely we are able to construct , by using compositions of dilations and the groupoid operation , approximately associative operations which shall lead us eventually to group operations in the tangent groupoid of a dilation . let @xmath511 be a dilation and @xmath540 the associated dilation of the @xmath90-double groupoid . further we shall be interested only in the properties of the following map . for any @xmath86 and any @xmath199 we define the * dilatation * : @xmath541 [ defdilc ] the domain of definition of @xmath542 is in fact only a subset of @xmath543 , according to the axiom 0 explained in definition [ dax0 ] section [ bordet ] . this map comes from the definition ( [ rtransdel ] ) of the dilation @xmath544 , namely @xmath545 for any @xmath199 with @xmath546 sufficiently small we can define @xmath547 ( as in figure [ figure2 ] ) from ( a subset of ) @xmath548 to @xmath1 . remark that @xmath549 , therefore the following composition is well defined : @xmath550 then @xmath551 . related to the function @xmath552 is the following @xmath553 the following expression makes sense too , for any pair of elements @xmath554 from ( a subset of ) @xmath555 : @xmath556 \\label{sumdef}\\ ] ] it is also true that @xmath557 . these three functions are interesting operations . the function @xmath558 is an approximate difference operation , @xmath559 is an approximate inverse and @xmath560 is an approximate sum operation . a look at the figure [ figure1 ] will help . there is graphically explained how @xmath561 is constructed . .,scaledwidth=50.0% ] let us imagine that we are looking at a figure in the euclidean plane . then @xmath562 is just a homothety , @xmath159 , @xmath563 are vectors with the same origin @xmath101 , @xmath564 is the difference of vectors @xmath565 ( or @xmath566 , it s the same as long as we are in a commutative world ) . in the euclidean plane , as @xmath546 goes to @xmath480 , the `` vector '' @xmath567 slides towards @xmath568 and @xmath561 is obtained from @xmath567 by composition with the vector @xmath569 . thus @xmath570 has the meaning of a approximate difference of vectors @xmath159 , @xmath563 . the functions @xmath558 , @xmath559 and @xmath560 can be expressed in terms of dilatations introduced in definition [ defdilc ] . indeed , let us define , for any triple @xmath347 with @xmath571 , and such that @xmath572 are sufficiently small , the following approximate difference function with three arguments : @xmath573 the approximate inverse function with two arguments : @xmath574 and the following approximate sum function with three arguments : @xmath575 we have then : @xmath576 we are in the framework of emergent algebras and idempotent right quasigroups , as introduced in @xcite . we recall here the definition of a idempotent right quasigroup and induced operations . an idempotent right quasigroup ( irq ) is a set @xmath0 endowed with two operations @xmath577 and @xmath578 , which satisfy the following axioms : for any @xmath579 1 . @xmath580 2 . @xmath581 we use these operations to define the sum , difference and inverse operations of the irq : for any @xmath582 1 . the difference operation is @xmath583 . by fixing the first variable @xmath584 we obtain the difference operation based at @xmath584 : @xmath585 . the sum operation is @xmath586 . by fixing the first variable @xmath584 we obtain the sum operation based at @xmath584 : @xmath587 . the inverse operation is @xmath588 . by fixing the first variable @xmath584 we obtain the inverse operator based at @xmath584 : @xmath589 . for any @xmath590 we define also the following operations : 1 . @xmath591 , @xmath592 , 2 . for any @xmath593 let @xmath594 and @xmath595 , 3 . for any @xmath596 let @xmath597 and @xmath598 . [ dplay ] for any @xmath599 the triple @xmath600 is a irq . we denote the difference , sum and inverse operations of @xmath600 by the same symbols as the ones used for @xmath601 , with a subscript `` @xmath602 '' . for any @xmath199 and for any @xmath66 we can define a irq operation on @xmath81 by @xmath603 . we have then : @xmath604 by computation it follows that @xmath605 . the approximate difference , sum and inverse operations are exactly the ones introduced in the preceding section . in @xcite we introduced idempotent right quasigroups and then iterates of the operations indexed by a parameter @xmath606 . this was done in order to simplify the notations mostly . here , in the presence of the group @xmath459 , we might define a @xmath459-irq . let @xmath459 be a commutative group . a @xmath459-idempotent right quasigroup is a set @xmath0 with a function @xmath607 such that @xmath608 is a irq and moreover for any @xmath472 and any @xmath293 we have @xmath609 [ defgammairq ] it is then obvious that if @xmath610 is a irq then @xmath611 is a @xmath612-irq ( we define @xmath613 ) . the following is a slight modification of proposition 3.4 and point ( k ) proposition 3.5 @xcite , for the case of @xmath459-irqs ( the proof of this proposition is almost identical , with obvious modifications , with the proof of the original proposition ) . in any irq @xmath614 be a @xmath459-irq . then we have the relations : 1 . @xmath615 2 . @xmath616 3 . @xmath617 4 . @xmath618 5 . @xmath619 6 . @xmath620 7 . @xmath621 8 . for any @xmath622 and any @xmath623 we have the distributivity property : @xmath624 [ pplay ] later we shall apply this proposition for the irq @xmath92 with the operations induced by dilatations @xmath465 . as @xmath625 the components of the deformations indexed by @xmath389 from the diagram [ figure2 ] ( namely the operation , norm and respective dilation maps ) may converge in the sense of section [ secdefconv ] to the components of another normed groupoid with dilations . 1 . there is a function @xmath626 which is the limit @xmath627 uniformly on bounded sets in the sense of definition [ defcon ] . moreover the convergence with respect to @xmath628 is the same as the convergence with respect to @xmath629 and in particular @xmath630 implies @xmath631 . 2 . there is a dilation @xmath632 of the normed groupoid @xmath633 such that for any @xmath199 the transformation @xmath634 converges uniformly on bounded sets to @xmath635 . indeed , these properties of the function @xmath628 come from the following observation . let us define on @xmath91 the function : @xmath641 then for any @xmath86 the function @xmath70 ( with two arguments ) gives a distance on the set @xmath81 . in the case of a @xmath484-structure the axiom a3 can be written as : @xmath642 uniformly on bounded sets . this gives properties ( b ) , ( c ) above from a passage to the limit of the properties of the distance @xmath70 . for any @xmath86 the restriction of the norm @xmath629 on the trivial groupoid @xmath643 gives a distance on the space @xmath81 . the dilatation @xmath644 has the property : for any @xmath199 and @xmath86 @xmath645 therefore we can define @xmath646 from ( a subset of ) @xmath647 to @xmath647 by : @xmath648 suppose that @xmath511 is a gw @xmath484-structure . then for any @xmath86 the triple @xmath649 is a dilatation structure , with @xmath484 defined by ( [ firstcomright ] ) and @xmath650 restrictioned to @xmath81 . the proof is just a translation of the definition [ defgdsweak ] in terms of metric spaces , using the equivalence between metric spaces and normed trivial groupoids . at the end we obtain definition [ defweakstrong ] of dilatation structures on metric spaces , given further . for simplicity we shall list the axioms of a dilatation structure @xmath651 without concerning about domains and codomains of dilatations . for the full definition of dilatation structure , as well as for their main properties and examples , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the notion appeared from my efforts to understand the last section of the paper @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . 1 . in the following definition [ defweakstrong ] we are no longer asking the metric space @xmath244 to be locally compact . also , uniform convergence in compact sets is replaced by uniform convergence in bounded sets . 2 . because of the modifications explained at ( a ) , we have to ask explicitly that the uniformities induced by @xmath652 and @xmath70 are the same . 3 . finally , dilatation structures in the sense of the following definition [ defweakstrong ] are a bit stronger than dilatation structures in the sense introduced and studied in @xcite , @xcite , namely we ask for the existence of a `` limit dilatation '' , see the last axiom . this limit exists for strong dilatation structures , but not for dilatation structures in the sense introduced in @xcite , @xcite . 1 . for any point @xmath66 the function @xmath484 induces an action @xmath656 , where @xmath657 is the collection of all continuous , with continuous inverse transformations @xmath658 such that @xmath659 . the function @xmath660 is continuous . moreover , it can be continuously extended to @xmath661 by @xmath662 and the limit @xmath663 is uniform with respect to @xmath664 in bounded set . 3 . there is @xmath665 such that for any @xmath584 there exists a function @xmath666 , defined for any @xmath667 in the closed ball ( in distance d ) @xmath668 , such that @xmath669 uniformly with respect to @xmath584 in bounded set . moreover the uniformity induced by @xmath670 is the same as the uniformity induced by @xmath70 , in particular @xmath671 implies @xmath672 . ( for metric spaces ) the following limit exists : @xmath673 for any @xmath512 , uniformly with respect to @xmath674 in bounded sets . in axiom a2 we may alternatively put that the limit is uniform with respect to @xmath678 . similarly , we may ask in axiom a4weak ( for metric spaces ) that the limit is uniform with respect to @xmath679 , @xmath680 . 1 . if @xmath244 is locally compact then the function @xmath681 is continuous as an uniform limit of continuous functions on a compact set . if @xmath244 is also separable then from the existence of the limit @xmath652 and from axiom a1 we obtain the fact that @xmath681 and @xmath70 induce the same uniformities . 2 . by definition @xmath652 is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality , but it can be a degenerated distance function : there might exist @xmath682 such that @xmath683.but the end of axiom a2 eliminates this possibility . let @xmath684 be a dilatation structure , @xmath66 , and let @xmath685 then the net of metric spaces @xmath686 converges in the gromov - hausdorff sense to the metric space @xmath687 . moreover this metric space is a metric cone , in the following sense : for any @xmath512 such that @xmath688 we have @xmath689 and @xmath690 the first part of the proposition is just a reformulation of axiom a3 , without the condition of uniform convergence . for the second part remark that @xmath691 and also that @xmath692 therefore if we pass to the limit with @xmath462 in these two relations we get the desired conclusion . @xmath321 let @xmath651 be a dilatation structure . the translation groupoid @xmath693 has as objects the distances @xmath694 for all @xmath66 and all @xmath199 . the arrows are of the form @xmath695 , with @xmath696 composition of arrows is composition of functions . [ transgrou ] @xmath693 is a groupoid . moreover , arrows are isometries , in the sense that for any @xmath199 and @xmath697 the arrow @xmath698 is an isometry from the source to the range : for ant @xmath699 we have : @xmath700 use proposition [ pplay ] . for example , the fact that composition of arrows is well defined is equivalent with ( e ) from the mentioned proposition . invertibility of arrows is ( a ) , and so on . the isometry claim follows from a straight computation . @xmath321 a * groupoid strong @xmath484-structure * ( or a gs @xmath484-structure ) is a triple @xmath701 such that @xmath484 is a map assigning to any @xmath199 a transformation @xmath469 which satisfies the axioms a1 , a2 from definition [ defgdsweak ] and the following axioms a3mod and a4 : m. buliga , dilatation structures in sub - riemannian geometry , ( 2007 ) , contemporary geometry and topology and related topics , cluj - napoca , cluj university press ( 2008 ) , 89 - 105 , http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.4298", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_310", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "a groupoid is a small category whose arrows are all invertible . more precisely we have the followin..."}

My best friend from college was married 18 years ago this week. As her maid of honor, I felt like a princess.

The other bridesmaids and I wore gorgeous emerald green dresses with a long satin bow in the back. Maybe because it was a Christmastime wedding, the dress was packed away with my Christmas decorations. It no longer fits, but I look at it every year as my children and I unpack ornaments. This year my daughter asked to try it on. The girls are both still teenagers and smaller than I was in my 20s, and it was too long for both of them still. They have both been in a wedding, and part of the excitement was helping them to find just the right dresses. If I had known of DressFirst.com then, finding them may have been easier. DressFirst.com is an online site selling wedding dresses, prom dresses, evening dresses, holiday dresses, homecoming dresses, etc. They have a large selection of both jr bridesmaid dresses and bridesmaid dresses. Actually, 换句话说 everything needed for a wedding can be ordered from this one website. From lovely floral bouquets to napkins and serving sets for the wedding cake and even invitations. Arranging a wedding with online conveniences is so much different than when I went to multiple businesses as I planned my own wedding.

{"question": "上下文中的'事实上'指的是什么？", "answer": "实际上", "context": "the paper is concerned with the spectral and computational analysis of effective preconditioners for linear systems arising from finite element approximations to the elliptic convection - diffusion problem @xmath0 with @xmath1 domain of @xmath2 . we consider a model setting in which the structured finite element partition is made by equi - lateral triangles . the interest of such a partition relies on the observation that automatic grid generators tend to construct equi - lateral triangles when the mesh is fine enough . the analysis is performed having in mind two popular preconditioned krylov methods . more precisely , we analyze the performances of the preconditioned conjugate gradient ( pcg ) method in the case of the diffusion problem and of the preconditioned generalized minimal residual ( pgmres ) in the case of the convection - diffusion problem . we define the preconditioner as a combination of a basic ( projected ) toeplitz matrix times diagonal structures . the diagonal part takes into account the variable coefficients in the operator of ( [ eq : modello ] ) , and especially the diffusion coefficient @xmath3 , while the ( projected ) toeplitz part derives from a special approximation of ( [ eq : modello ] ) when setting the diffusion coefficient to @xmath4 and the convective velocity field to @xmath5 . under such assumptions , if the problem is coercive , and the diffusive and convective coefficients are regular enough , then the proposed preconditioned matrix sequences have a strong clustering at unity , the preconditioning matrix sequence and the original matrix sequence are spectrally equivalent , and the eigenvector matrices have a mild conditioning . the obtained results allow to show the optimality of the related preconditioned krylov methods . it is important to stress that interest of such a study relies on the observation that automatic grid generators tend to construct equi - lateral triangles when the mesh is fine enough . numerical tests , both on the model setting and in the non - structured case , show the effectiveness of the proposal and the correctness of the theoretical findings . the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sez : fem ] we report a brief description of the fe approximation of convection - diffusion equations and the preconditioner definition . section [ sez : clustering ] is devoted to the spectral analysis of the underlying preconditioned matrix sequences , in the case of structured uniform meshes . in section [ sez : numerical_tests ] , after a preliminary discussion on complexity issues , selected numerical tests illustrate the convergence properties stated in the former section and their extension under weakened assumption or in the case of unstructured meshes . a final section [ sez : conclusions ] deals with perspectives and future works . problem ( [ eq : modello ] ) can be stated in variational form as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the space of square integrable functions , with square integrable weak derivatives vanishing on @xmath8 . we assume that @xmath1 is a polygonal domain and we make the following hypotheses on the coefficients : @xmath9 the previous assumptions guarantee existence and uniqueness for problem ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale ] ) and hence the existence and uniqueness of the ( weak ) solution for problem ( [ eq : modello ] ) . for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to linear finite element approximation of problem ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale ] ) . to this end , let @xmath10 be a usual finite element partition of @xmath11 into triangles , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 . let @xmath14 be the space of linear finite elements , i.e. @xmath15 the finite element approximation of problem ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale ] ) reads : @xmath16 for each internal node @xmath17 of the mesh @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be such that @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if @xmath22 . then , the collection of all @xmath23 s is a base for @xmath24 . we will denote by @xmath25 the number of the internal nodes of @xmath18 , which corresponds to the dimension of @xmath24 . then , we write @xmath26 as @xmath27 and the variational equation ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale_fe ] ) becomes an algebraic linear system : @xmath28 according to these notations and definitions , the algebraic equations in ( [ [隐藏] : modello_discreto ] ) can be rewritten in matrix form as the linear system @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the approximation of the diffusive term and approximation of the convective term , respectively . more precisely , we have @xmath32 where suitable quadrature formula are considered in the case of non constant coefficient functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as well known , the main drawback in the linear system resolution is due to the asymptotical ill - conditioning ( i.e. very large for large dimensions ) , so that preconditioning is highly recommended . hereafter , we refer to a preconditioning strategy previously analyzed in the case of fd / fe approximations of the diffusion problem @xcite and recently applied to fd / fe approximations @xcite of ( [ eq : modello ] ) with respect to the preconditioned hermitian and skew - hermitian splitting ( phss ) method @xcite . more precisely , the preconditioning matrix sequence @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , i.e. , the suitable scaled main diagonal of @xmath38 and clearly @xmath38 equals @xmath30 . the computational aspects of this preconditioning strategy with respect to krylov methods will be discussed later in section [ sez : complexity_issues ] . here , preliminarily we want to stress as the preconditioner is tuned only with respect to the diffusion matrix @xmath30 : in other words , we are implicity assuming that the convection phenomenon is not dominant , and no stabilization is required in order to avoid spurious oscillations into the solution . moreover , the spectral analysis is performed in the non - hermitian case by referring to the hermitian and skew - hermitian ( hss ) decomposition of @xmath39 ( that can be performed on any single elementary matrix related to @xmath18 by considering the standard assembling procedure ) . according to the definition , the hss decomposition is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 since by definition , the diffusion term @xmath30 is a hermitian matrix and does not contribute to the skew - hermitian part of @xmath39 . notice also that @xmath42 if @xmath43 . more in general , the matrix @xmath44 is symmetric and positive definite whenever @xmath45 . indeed , without the condition @xmath46 , the matrix @xmath47 does not have a definite sign in general : in fact , a specific analysis of the involved constants is required in order to guarantee the nonnegativity of the term @xmath47 . moreover , the lemma below allows to obtain further information regarding such a spectral assumption , where @xmath48 indicate both the usual vector norms and the induced matrix norms . _ @xcite _ [ lemma : normae ] let @xmath49 be the matrix sequence defined according to _ ( [ eq : def_e_nb])_. under the assumptions in _ ( [ eq : ipotesi_coefficienti ] ) _ , then we find @xmath50 with @xmath51 absolute positive constant only depending on @xmath52 and @xmath1 . the claim holds both in the case in which the matrix elements in _ ( [ eq : def_psi ] ) _ are evaluated exactly and whenever a quadrature formula with error @xmath53 is considered for approximating the involved integrals . hereafter , we will denote by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , the matrix sequence associated to a family of meshes @xmath56 , with decreasing finesse parameter @xmath57 . as customary , the whole preconditioning analysis will refer to a matrix sequence instead to a single matrix , since the goal is to quantify the difficulty of the linear system resolution in relation to the accuracy of the chosen approximation scheme . the aim of this section is to analyze the spectral properties of the preconditioned matrix sequences @xmath58 in the case of some special domains @xmath1 partitioned with structured uniform meshes , so that spectral tools derived from toeplitz theory @xcite can be successfully applied . the applicative interest of the considered type of domains will be motivated in the short . indeed , let @xmath59 be a @xmath60variate lebesgue integrable function defined over @xmath61 ^ 2 $ ] . by referring to the fourier coefficients of this function @xmath59 , called generating function , @xmath62 with @xmath63 , one can build the sequence of toeplitz matrices @xmath64 . the matrix @xmath65 is said to be the toeplitz matrix of order @xmath66 , @xmath67 , generated by @xmath59 . now , the spectral properties of the matrix sequence @xmath64 are completely understood and characterized in terms of the underlying generating functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) . in the following , with respect to the latter claim , we will refer to the notion of equivalent generating functions . in such a respect , we claim that two nonnegative function @xmath59 and @xmath68 defined over a domain @xmath69 are equivalent if and only if @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 means that there exists a pure positive constant @xmath73 such that @xmath74 almost everywhere on @xmath69 . + ( a ) ( b ) the main motivation of this paper lies in the analysis of the template case reported in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a , where we consider a partition into equilateral triangles . it is self - evident that such a problem represents just an academic example . however , it is a fact that a professional mesh generator will locally produce a partitioning , which is `` asymptotically '' similar to the one reported in the figure . our goal is to prove the pcg optimality with respect to the diffusion problem approximation , i.e. , the number of iterations for reaching the solution , within a fixed accuracy , can be bounded from above by a constant independent of the dimension @xmath55 . some additional results about pgmres convergence properties in the case of the convection - diffusion problem approximation are also reported , both in the case of the hexagonal domain @xmath1 with a structured uniform mesh as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a and in the case @xmath75 with a structured uniform mesh as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].b , so extending previous results proved in @xcite with respect to the phss method @xcite . the spectral analysis makes reference to the following definition . _ @xcite _ [ def : cluster ] let @xmath76 be a sequence of hermitian matrices of increasing dimensions @xmath77 . the sequence @xmath76 is clustered at @xmath78 in the eigenvalue sense if for any @xmath79 , @xmath80 . the sequence @xmath76 is properly ( or strongly ) clustered at @xmath78 if for any @xmath81 the number of the eigenvalues of @xmath82 not belonging to @xmath83 can be bounded by a pure constant eventually depending on @xmath84 , but not on @xmath77 . in the case of non - hermitian matrices , the same definition can be extended by considering the complex disk @xmath85 , instead of the interval @xmath83 . we start by considering the simpler diffusion problem , i.e. , the analysis concerns the hermitian matrix sequences @xmath86 , @xmath87 . due to the very special choice of the domain @xmath1 , the matrices @xmath87 arising in the case @xmath88 with structured meshes as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a result to be a proper projection of toeplitz matrices generated by the function @xmath89 , @xmath90 ^ 2 $ ] , related to a bigger parallelogram shaped domain @xmath91 containing @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni_parallelogrammi ] ) , i.e. , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 number of the internal nodes . here , @xmath94 , @xmath95 is a proper projection matrix simply cutting those rows ( columns ) referring to nodes belonging to @xmath91 , but not to @xmath1 . thus , the matrix is full rank , i.e. , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . in the same way , we can also consider the toeplitz matrix with the same generating function arising when considering a smaller parallelogram shaped domain @xmath98 contained in @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 , @xmath101 proper projection matrix and such that @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . these embedding arguments allow to bound , according to the min - max principle ( see @xcite for more details on the use of this proof technique ) , the minimal eigenvalue of the matrices @xmath104 as follows @xmath105 a first technical step in our spectral analysis concerns relationships between this generating function @xmath106 and the more classical generating function @xmath107 arising in the case of fe approximations on a square @xmath75 with friedrichs - keller meshes ( see figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].b ) , or standard fd discretizations . it can be easily observed that these two function are equivalent , in the sense of the previously reported definition , since we have @xmath108 ^ 2.\\ ] ] thus , because @xmath109 is a matrix - valued linear positive operator ( lpo ) for every @xmath77 @xcite , the toeplitz matrix sequences generated by this equivalent functions result to be spectrally equivalent , i.e. , for any @xmath77 @xmath110 furthermore , due to the strict positivity of every @xmath109 ( see @xcite for the precise definition ) , since @xmath111 is not identically zero , we have that @xmath112 is positive definite , and since @xmath113 is not identically zero , we find that @xmath114 is also positive definite . here , we are referring to the standard ordering relation between hermitian matrices , i.e. , the notation @xmath115 , with @xmath116 and @xmath117 hermitian matrices , means that @xmath118 is nonnegative definite . an interesting remark pertains to the fact that the function @xmath106 is the most natural one from the fe point of view , since no contribution are lost owing to the gradient orthogonality as instead in the case related to @xmath59 ; nevertheless its relationships with the function @xmath59 can be fully exploited in performing the spectral analysis . more precisely , from ( [ eq : lmin_proiezione ] ) and ( [ eq : rel_toeplitz ] ) and taking into account ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath119 we deduce @xmath120 following the very same reasoning , we also find that @xmath121 since , by the embedding argument , both @xmath93 and @xmath122 are asymptotic to @xmath77 , it follows that @xmath123 . finally , following the same analysis for the maximal eigenvalue , we find @xmath124 where , by @xcite , we know that @xmath125 and hence the spectral condition number of @xmath104 grows as @xmath126 i.e. @xmath127 where the constant hidden in the previous relation is mild and can be easily estimated . it is worth stressing that the same matrix @xmath128 can also be considered in a more general setting . in fact , the matrix sequence @xmath86 can also be defined as @xmath129 , since again each internal node in @xmath1 is a vertex of the same constant number of triangles . therefore , by referring to projection arguments , the spectral analysis can be equivalently performed both on the matrix sequence @xmath86 and @xmath130 . no matter about this choice , we make use of a second technical step , which is based on standard taylor s expansions . [ lemma : taylor_expansion_esagoni ] let @xmath131 , with @xmath132 and @xmath1 hexagonal domain partitioned as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a . for any @xmath78 such that @xmath133 there exists a proper @xmath134 such that the taylor s expansions centered at a proper @xmath134 have the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are constants independent of @xmath57 . + -1.0 cm in the cases at hand , the validity of this claim is just a direct check : the key point relies in the symmetry properties induced by the structured uniform nature of the considered meshes , both in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath91 . hereafter , we give some detail with respect to the case of the hexagonal domain partitioned as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a , see @xcite for the proof in the case @xmath75 . thus , let s consider the taylor s expansion centered at a proper @xmath134 . by calling @xmath138 and similarly denoting the derivatives of the diffusion coefficient , it holds that @xmath139 with @xmath140^t \\|$ ] and @xmath141 denoting the barycenter of the triangle @xmath142 . by referring to the assembling procedure , we will choose as center of the related taylor s expansion in the case of figure [ fig : simmetrie].b-[fig : simmetrie].d the point marked by @xmath143 . the symmetric position of the involved triangle barycenters ( marked by @xmath144 ) , with respect to @xmath143 allows to claim ( [ eq : exp.a ] ) . the same holds true for ( [ eq : exp.b ] ) by considering each pertinent point @xmath143 in figure [ fig : simmetrie].a and , analogously , for ( [ eq : exp.c ] ) .

[ teo : clu+sb_ima ] let @xmath162 and @xmath35 be the hermitian matrix sequences defined according to _ ( [ eq : def_ima ] ) _ and _ ( [ eq : def_p ] ) _ in the case of the hexagonal domain partitioned as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a . under the assumptions in _ ( [ eq : ipotesi_coefficienti ] ) _ , the sequence @xmath163 is spectrally bounded and properly clustered at @xmath5 with respect to the eigenvalues . the claim holds both in the case in which the matrix elements in _ ( [ eq : def_psi ] ) _ are evaluated exactly and whenever a quadrature formula with error @xmath53 is considered to approximate the involved integrals . this result has been proved in @xcite with respect to friedrichs - keller triangulations , but it can easily be extended to the case of matrix sequences arising in the case of a fe partitioning as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a by using the same arguments . on the basis of these two splitted spectral results , we can easily obtain the spectral description of the whole preconditioned matrix sequence @xmath164 , according to the theorem below . the proof technique refers to an analogous result proved in @xcite with respect to fd discretizations of convection - diffusion equations . [ teo : clua ] let @xmath165 and @xmath35 be the matrix sequences defined according to _ ( [ eq : def_a ] ) _ and _ ( [ eq : def_p ] ) _ , both in the case of the hexagonal domain @xmath1 with a structured uniform mesh as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a and in the case @xmath75 with a structured uniform mesh as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].b under the assumptions in _ ( [ eq : ipotesi_coefficienti ] ) _ , the sequence @xmath164 is properly clustered at @xmath166 with respect to the eigenvalues . in addition , these eigenvalues all belong to a uniformly bounded rectangle with positive real part , well separated from zero . the claim holds both in the case in which the matrix elements in _ ( [ eq : def_theta ] ) _ and _ ( [ eq : def_psi ] ) _ are evaluated exactly and whenever a quadrature formula with error @xmath53 is considered to approximate the involved integrals . a localization result for the eigenvalues of the sequence @xmath167 can be stated simply by referring to the properties of the field of values of the preconditioned matrix : in fact , for any @xmath17 @xmath168 where @xmath169 since for any @xmath17 @xmath170 the claimed localization result is obtained as a consequence of those previously proved in theorems [ teo : clu+se_rea_esagoni ] and [ teo : clu+sb_ima ] . moreover , the same localization results together with the claimed clustering properties allow to apply theorem 4.3 in @xcite and the proof is concluded . the subsequent result , giving estimates on the condition number of the eigenvector matrix of the preconditioned structure , is of interest in the study of the convergence speed of the gmres . in particular a logarithmic growth in number of iteration is associated to a polynomial bound in the spectral condition number : such a bound is precisely given below . [ lemmma : eigenvectors ] let @xmath3 and @xmath52 constant functions and let @xmath165 and @xmath35 be the matrix sequences defined as in theorem [ teo : clua ] @xmath171 can be diagonalized as @xmath172 where the matrix of the eigenvectors @xmath173 can be chosen such that @xmath174 . under the quoted assumption it holds that @xmath175 and @xmath31 is skew - symmetric . thus , we have @xmath176 with @xmath177 skew - symmetric matrix . therefore , the matrix @xmath178 is a normal normal , so that @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is diagonal and @xmath181 is unitary . consequently , @xmath182 with @xmath183 eigenvector matrix . due to the fact that @xmath181 is unitary , we have @xmath184 and finally @xmath185 by invoking the key relation ( [ eq : cond - an1 ] ) . the section is divided into two parts . in the first we briefly discuss the complexity features of our preconditioning proposals . in the second part we report and critically discuss few numerical experiments in which the meshes are both structured and unstructured , while the regularity features required by the theoretical analysis are somehow relaxed . first of all , we report some remarks about the computational costs of the proposed iterative procedure . the main idea is that such a technique is easily applicable . in fact , a krylov method is considered , so simply requiring a matrix vector routine for sparse matrices and a solver for the chosen preconditioner . + therefore , since the preconditioner is defined as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 , the solution of the linear system in ( [ eq : modello_discreto ] ) with matrix @xmath39 is reduced to computations involving diagonals and the matrix @xmath188 ( @xmath189 and @xmath188 for the diffusion problem , respectively ) . as well known , whenever the domain is partitioned by considering a uniform structured mesh this latter task can be efficiently performed by means of fast poisson solvers , among which we can list those based on the cyclic reduction idea ( see e.g. @xcite ) and several specialized algebraic or geometric multigrid methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in addition , the latter can be efficiently considered also in more general mesh settings . the underlying idea is that the main effort in devising efficient algorithms must be devoted only to this simpler problem with constant coefficient , instead of the general one . now , the effectiveness of the proposed method is measured by referring to the optimality definition below . _ @xcite _ [ def : opt ] let @xmath190 be a given sequence of linear systems of increasing dimensions . an iterative method is _ optimal _ if 1 . the arithmetic cost of each iteration is at most proportional to the complexity of a matrix - vector product with matrix @xmath191 , 2 . the number of iterations for reaching the solution within a fixed accuracy can be bounded from above by a constant independent of @xmath192 . in such a respect theorem [ teo : clu+se_a_esagoni ] proves the optimality of the pcg method : the iterations number for reaching the solution within a fixed accuracy can be bounded from above by a constant independent of the dimension @xmath55 and the arithmetic cost of each iteration is at most proportional to the complexity of a matrix - vector product with matrix @xmath38 . moreover , theorem [ teo : clua ] proves that all the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix belong in a complex rectangle @xmath193 , \\ \\mathrm{im}(z ) \\in [ -\\hat{d},\\hat{d}]\\}$ ] , with @xmath194 , @xmath195 independent of the dimension @xmath55 . it is worth stressing that the existence of a proper eigenvalue cluster and the aforementioned localization results in the preconditioned spectrum can be very important for fast convergence of preconditioned gmres iterations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . finally , we want to give notice that the pcg / pgmres numerical performances do not get worse in the case of unstructured meshes , despite the lack of a rigorous proof . before analyzing in detail selected numerical results , we wish to give technical information on the performed numerical experiments . we apply the pcg or the pgmres method , in the symmetric and non - symmetric case , respectively , with the preconditioning strategy described in section [ sez : fem ] , to fe approximations of the problem ( [ eq : modello ] ) . whenever required , the involved integrals have been approximated by means of the barycentric quadrature rule ( the approximation by means of the nodal quadrature rule gives rise to similar results , indeed both are exact when applied to linear functions ) . the domains of integration @xmath1 are those reported in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni ] and we assume dirichlet boundary conditions . all the reported numerical experiments are performed in matlab , by employing the available ` pcg ` and ` gmres ` library functions ; the iterative solvers start with zero initial guess and the stopping criterion @xmath196 is considered . the case of unstructured meshes is also discussed and compared , together with various types of regularity in the diffusion coefficient . in fact , we consider the case of a coefficient function satisfying the assumptions ( [ eq : ipotesi_coefficienti ] ) . more precisely , the second columns in table [ tab : it - es123esagono_triangoliequilateri_m5 ] report the number of iterations required to achieve the convergence for increasing values of the coefficient matrix size @xmath55 when considering the fe approximation with structured uniform meshes as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni ] and with template function @xmath197 , @xmath198^t$].the subsequent meshes are obtained by means of a progressive refinement procedure , consisting in adding new nodes corresponding to the middle point of each edge . the numerical experiments plainly confirm the previous theoretical analysis in section [ sez : clustering ] : the convergence behavior does not depend on the coefficient matrix dimension @xmath55 . as anticipated , despite the lack of corresponding theoretical results , we want to test the convergence behavior also in the case in which the regularity assumption on @xmath199 in theorems [ teo : clu+se_a_esagoni ] and [ teo : clua ] are not satisfied . the analysis is motivated by favorable known numerical results in the case of fd approximations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) or fe approximation with only the diffusion term @xcite . more precisely , we consider as template the @xmath200 function @xmath201 , the @xmath202 function @xmath203 , with @xmath204 or @xmath205 . the number of required iterations is listed in the remaining columns in table [ tab : it - es123esagono_triangoliequilateri_m5 ] . notice that also in these cases with a @xmath200 or @xmath202 diffusion function , the iteration count does not depend on the coefficient matrix dimension @xmath55 . the same results are reported in table [ tab : it - es123quadrato_triangolirettangoli_m1 ] with respect to structured uniform meshes on the domain @xmath75 . furthermore , we want to test our proposal in the case of some unstructured meshes generated by triangle @xcite with a progressive refinement procedure . the first meshes in the considered mesh sequences are reported in figures [ fig : mesh_m6newnew ] and [ fig : mesh_m4 ] , respectively . tables [ tab : it - es123esagono_unstructured_m6newnew ] and [ tab : it - es123quadrato_unstructured_m4 ] report the number of required iterations in the case of the previous template functions . negligible differences in the iteration trends are observed for increasing dimensions @xmath77 . all these remarks are in perfect agreement with the outliers analysis of the matrices @xmath206 , with respect to a cluster at @xmath207 ( see some examples in figure [ fig : outlier_analysis ] ) . to conclude the section we take into consideration the more realistic setting in which the meshes are generated by a specialized automatic procedure . according to this point of view , we have applied a spectral approximation of the matrix sequence @xmath208 in terms of product of low - cost matrix structures , i.e. , @xmath104 and @xmath209 , that carry the `` structural '' content of the variational problem and the specific `` informative '' content contained in the diffusion coefficient function @xmath210 , respectively . however , the matrix @xmath104 can be still not easy to handle . therefore , we go beyond in such idea by defining a preconditioner @xmath211 in which the matrix @xmath104 related to the unstructured mesh is replaced by a suitable projection of the toeplitz matrix @xmath212 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ^ 2 $ ] ( see section [ sez : diffusion_equation ] ) . the numerical results are reported in table [ tab : it_perturbed_mesh ] . as expected , the number of iterations is a constant with respect to the dimension when the preconditioner @xmath213 is applied . nevertheless , for @xmath77 large enough , the same seems to be true also for the preconditioner @xmath211 . indeed , for increasing dimensions @xmath77 , the unstructured partitioning is more and more similar to the one given by equilateral triangles sketched in fig . [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a . a theoretical ground supporting these observation is still missing and would be worth in our opinion to be studied and developed . @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 37 & 3 & 4 & 5 + 169 & 3 & 4 & 5 + 721 & 3 & 4 & 4 + 2977 & 3 & 4 & 4 + 12097 & 3 & 4 & 4 + 48769 & 3 & 4 & 4 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 37 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 169 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 721 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 2977 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 12097 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 48769 & 4 & 5 & 5 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 81 & 3 & 4 & 4 + 361 & 3 & 4 & 5 + 1521 & 3 & 4 & 5 + 6241 & 3 & 4 & 5 + 25281 & 3 & 4 & 5 + 128881 & 3 & 4 & 5 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 81 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 3611 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 1521 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 6241 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 25281 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 128881 & 4 & 5 & 5 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 28 & 5 & 5 & 5 + 73 & 4 & 4 & 5 + 265 & 4 & 4 & 5 + 1175 & 4 & 4 & 5 + 4732 & 4 & 4 & 5 + 19288 & 4 & 4 & 5 + 76110 & 4 & 4 & 4 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 28 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 73 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 265 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 1175 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 4732 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 19288 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 76110 & 4 & 5 & 5 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 24 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 109 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 465 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 1921 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 7809 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 31489 & 4 & 5 & 5 + @xmath77 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 24 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 109 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 465 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 1921 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 7809 & 4 & 5 & 5 + 31489 & 4 & 5 & 5 + [ tab : it - es123esagono_perturbed ] @xmath77 & @xmath217 & @xmath218 + 37 & 4 & 8 + 169 & 4 & 10 + 721 & 4 & 11 + 2977 & 4 & 11 + 12095 & 4 & 13 + 48769 & 4 & 16 + @xmath77 & @xmath217 & @xmath218 + 37 & 4 & 8 + 169 & 4 & 9 + 721 & 4 & 9 + 2977 & 4 & 10 + 12095 & 4 & 11 + 48769 & 4 & 13 + -0.3 cm + -4.5 cm -0.5 cm -3.5 cm -0.5 cm -0.5 cm + -0.5 cm -0.5 cm + -0.5 cm -0.5 cm as emphasized in the introduction it is clear that the problem in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a is just an academic example , due to the perfect structure made by equi - lateral triangles . however , it is a fact that a professional mesh generator will produce a partitioning , which `` asymptotically '' , that is a for a mesh fine enough , tends to the one in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a . the latter fact has a practical important counterpart , since the academic preconditioner @xmath219 is optimal for the real case with nonconstant coefficients and with the partitioning in b ) . a theoretical ground supporting these observations is still missing and would be worth in our opinion to be studied and developed in three directions : a ) giving a formal notion of convergence of a partitioning to a structured one , b ) proving spectral and convergence results in the case of an asymptotically structured partitioning , c ) extending the spectral analysis in the case of weak regularity assumptions . other possible developments include the case of higher order finite element spaces : it would be intriguing to find an expression of the underlying toeplitz symbol as a function of the different parameters in the considered finite element space ( degrees of freedom , polynomial degree , geometry of the mesh ) , and this could be done uniformly in @xmath220 dimension , i.e. for equation ( [ eq : modello ] ) with @xmath221 , @xmath222 . 10 o. axelsson , m. neytcheva , _ the algebraic multilevel iteration methods theory and applications . _ in _ proceedings of the second international colloquium on numerical analysis _ ( plovdiv , 1993 ) , 1323 , vsp , 1994 . z. bai , g.h . golub , m.k . ng , _ hermitian and skew - hermitian splitting methods for non - hermitian positive definite linear systems . _ siam j. matrix anal .

{"question": "上下文中的'通过手机进行的金融服务'指的是什么？", "answer": "Mobile Banking", "context": "In the past five years the percentage of weekly mobile banking users has more than tripled — from 9% in 2010 to 30% in 2015 — while weekly branch visitors fell from 40% to 24% in the same time frame. 2015 marked the first time that weekly mobile bankers (30%) exceeded branch bankers (24%) in Javelin’s survey. “What is driving this incredible growth? Smartphones and tablets are gaining rapidly in consumer adoption but it’s also a function of the fact that mobile banking services have not only proliferated but increased in the quality and features they offer consumers,” said Javelin analyst Daniel Van Dyke during a January 27 webinar reviewing the firm’s [隐藏], Smartphone and Tablet Forecast. Javelin’s recent report Digital Account Opening Reaches The Tipping Point also found that more Americans are applying for credit cards, loans and investment products through digital channels than physical ones. Javelin has argued that “FIs that fail to divert resources from branch to digital suffer a large opportunity cost, missing out in lowered servicing costs for basic transactions and in sales of new products.” The service costs argument rings particularly true for mobile deposit, with Chase citing a cost of 65 cents for each teller deposit vs only 3 cents using mobile. While 38 percent of big bank customers utilize mobile deposit, only 18 percent of community bank and 16 percent of credit union customers do, placing these institutions at a significant disadvantage in terms of service costs. The branch network, which peaked at 99,550 U.S. locations in 2009, has dropped each year since. The latest FDIC figure of 93,283 represents a 6.3 percent decline in the last six years, although Bryan Yurcan of American Banker was quick to point out that \"most of that reduction has come with the nation's largest banks shedding inventory ... many smaller banks have held steady, and even increased, branch numbers.\" Predicting that account maintenance will increasingly be performed on mobile devices but there will be times that customers seek face-to-face advice, Schwanhausser said FIs need to \"get into the business where they're influencing the behavior of their customers, guiding them to a smarter way to manage their finances. Those are very 据悉 kinds of conversations. It's not about eliminating (the branch) but how do we put the pieces together in a more coherent way?\" While early adopters of smartwatches tend to be affluent or part of Gen Y2 (ages 25-34), mobile bankers no longer carry such unique characteristics. As Van Dyke put it, \"The mobile banker of today is the banking customer of today. They're becoming indistinguishable.\" Mobile banking has become so commonplace that Javelin projects 80 percent of consumers will be engaging in it — on a 90 day basis — by 2020. In 2015 74 percent of mobile banking users employed an app and 69 percent utilized a mobile browser, dwarfing the 31 percent using SMS text messaging. Schwanhausser said FIs will continue to wrestle with the question of what to make available in the app: \"Do you make it fine tuned and focused and streamlined or replicate what can be viewed in online banking?\" Van Dyke predicts that banks will continue to take advantage of device-specific capabilities, whether using the camera for mobile deposit or geolocation to identify nearby ATMs. \"Things like that will underscore the need to offer superior experiences on the app,\" said Van Dyke. 2015 marked a continuation of Android's dominance, as the operating system grew its share of the U.S. tablet market from 45 to 48 percent and its share of the U.S. smartphone market from 47 to 49 percent. Apple's tablet share fell from 46 to 43 percent, with its smartphone share dropping from 46 to 45 percent. While Apple's numbers have been moving in the wrong direction Van Dyke reiterated that iOS users are the most valuable that an FI can serve. \"iPhone users show extremely unique characteristics. They bank more often, they make payments more often,\" said Dyke. \"When it comes to banks and payment providers iPhone owners are the gold standard.\" In addition to serving Android users, Javelin recommended that FIs prioritize an app on Amazon — but only after all iOS and Android device types have been addressed. Javelin suggested that there was no value in supporting Windows or Blackberry users, who only represent 4 and 2 percent of the smartphone market respectively.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_320", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "In the past five years the percentage of weekly mobile banking users has more than tripled — from 9%..."}

{"question": "上下文中的'消息来源称'指的是什么？", "answer": "据报道", "context": "studying qcd at finite baryon density is the traditional subject of nuclear physics . the behaviour of qcd at finite baryon density and low temperature is central for astrophysics to understand the structure of compact stars , and conditions near the core of collapsing stars ( supernovae , hypernovae ) . it is known that sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase . this was proposed several decades ago by frautschi @xcite and barrois @xcite by noticing that one - gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in the color antitriplet channel . from bcs theory @xcite , we know that if there is a weak attractive interaction in a cold fermi sea , the system is unstable with respect to the formation of particle - particle cooper - pair condensate in the momentum space . studies on color superconducting phase in 1980 s can be found in ref . the topic of color superconductivity stirred a lot of interest in recent years @xcite . for reviews on recent progress of color superconductivity see , for example , ref . @xcite . the color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars . to form bulk matter inside compact stars , the charge neutrality condition as well as @xmath0 equilibrium are required @xcite . this induces mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks . it is clear that the cooper pairing will be eventually destroyed with the increase of mismatch . without the constraint from the charge neutrality condition , the system may exhibit a first order phase transition from the color superconducting phase to the normal phase when the mismatch increases @xcite . it was also found that the system can experience a spatial non - uniform loff ( larkin - ovchinnikov - fudde - ferrell ) state @xcite in a certain window of moderate mismatch . it is still not fully understood how the cooper pairing will be eventually destroyed by increasing mismatch in a charge neutral system . the charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system . if the charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally , and also if the surface tension is small , the mixed phase will be favored @xcite . it is difficult to precisely calculate the surface tension in the mixed phase , thus in the following , we would like to focus on the homogeneous phase when the charge neutrality condition is required locally . it was found that homogeneous neutral cold - dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) phase @xcite or gapless cfl ( gcfl ) phase @xcite , depending on the flavor structure of the system . the gapless state resembles the unstable sarma state @xcite . however , under a natural charge neutrality condition , i.e. , only neutral matter can exist , the gapless phase is indeed a thermal stable state as shown in @xcite . the existence of thermal stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed in refs . @xcite and generalized to finite temperatures in refs . recent results based on more careful numerical calculations show that the g2sc and gcfl phases can exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram @xcite . one of the most important properties of an ordinary superconductor is the meissner effect , i.e. , the superconductor expels the magnetic field @xcite . in ideal color superconducting phases , e.g. , in the 2sc and cfl phases , the gauge bosons connected with the broken generators obtain masses , which indicates the meissner screening effect @xcite . the meissner effect can be understood using the standard anderson - higgs mechanism . unexpectedly , it was found that in the g2sc phase , the meissner screening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken generators of @xmath1 become imaginary , which indicates a type of chromomagnetic instability in the g2sc phase @xcite . the calculations in the gcfl phase show the same type of chromomagnetic instability @xcite . remembering the discovery of superfluidity density instability @xcite in the gapless interior - gap state @xcite , it seems that the instability is a inherent property of gapless phases . ( there are several exceptions : 1 ) it is shown that there is no chromomangetic instability near the critical temperature @xcite ; 2 ) it is also found that the gapless phase in strong coupling region is free of any instabilities @xcite . ) the chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase still remains as a puzzle . by observing that , the 8-th gluon s chromomagnetic instability is related to the instability with respect to a virtual net momentum of diquark pair , giannakis and ren suggested that a loff state might be the true ground state @xcite . their further calculations show that there is no chromomagnetic instability in a narrow loff window when the local stability condition is satisfied @xcite . latter on , it was found in ref . @xcite that a charge neutral loff state can not cure the instability of off - diagonal 4 - 7th gluons , while a gluon condensate state @xcite can do the job . in ref . @xcite we further pointed out that , when charge neutrality condition is required , there exists another narrow unstable loff window , not only off - diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8-th gluon can not avoid the magnetic instability . in a minimal model of gapless color supercondutor , hong showed in ref . @xcite that the mismatch can induce a spontaneous nambu - goldstone current generation . the nambu - goldstone current generation state in u(1 ) case resembles the one - plane wave loff state or diagonal gauge boson s condensate . we extended the nambu - goldstone current generation picture to the 2sc case in the nonlinear realization framework in ref . we show that five pseudo nambu - goldstone currents can be spontaneously generated by increasing the mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks . the nambu - goldstone currents generation state covers the gluon phase as well as the one - plane wave loff state . this article is organized as follows . in sec . [ sec - gnjl ] , we describe the framework of the gauged su(2 ) nambu jona - lasinio ( gnjl ) model in @xmath0-equilibrium . we review chromomagnetic instabilities in sec . [ sec - mag - ins ] . we discuss neutral baryon current instability and the loff state in sec . [ sec - bc ] . then sec . [ sec - ng - current ] gives a general nambu - goldstone currents generation description in the non - linearization framework . at the end , we give the discussion and summary in sec . [ sec - sum ] . we take the gauged form of the extended nambu jona - lasinio model @xcite , the lagrangian density has the form of @xmath2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g_d[(i { \\bar q}^c \\varepsilon \\epsilon^{b } \\gamma_5 q ) ( i { \\bar q } \\varepsilon \\epsilon^{b } \\gamma_5 q^c ) ] , \\label{lg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 . here @xmath4 are gluon fields and @xmath5 with @xmath6 are generators of @xmath7 gauge groups . please note that we regard all the gauge fields as external fields , which are weakly interacting with the system . the property of the color superconducting phase characterized by the diquark gap parameter is determined by the unkown nonperturbative gluon fields , which has been simply replaced by the four - fermion interaction in the njl model . however , the external gluon fields do not contribute to the properties of the system . therefore , we do not have the contribution to the lagrangian density from gauge field part @xmath8 as introduced in ref . @xcite . . [ sec - ng - current ] , by using the non - linear realization in the gnjl model , we will derive one nambu - goldstone currents state , which is equivalent to the so - called gluon - condensate state . ) in the lagrangian density eq .

( [ g - disp ] ) , we can read that , when @xmath45 , there will be excitations of gapless modes in the system . the thermodynamic potential corresponding to the solution of the gapless state @xmath45 is a local maximum . however , under certain constraint , e.g. , the charge neutrality condition , the gapless 2sc phase can be a thermal stable state @xcite . in this section , we review the chromomagnetic instabilities driven by mismatch in 2sc and g2sc phases as shown in ref . the polarization tensor in momentum space has the following general structure : @xmath46 . \\label{pipscfng}\\ ] ] the trace here runs over the dirac indices and the vertices @xmath47 with @xmath48 . gluons @xmath52 of the unbroken @xmath53 subgroup couple only to the red and green quarks . the general expression for the polarization tensor @xmath54 with @xmath55 is diagonal . after performing the traces over the color , flavor and nambu - gorkov indices , the expression has the form of @xmath56 , \\label{pi11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by making use of the definition in eq .

( [ m_d_1 ] ) vanishes in the gapped phase ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) . as in the case of the ideal 2sc phase , this reflects the fact that there are no gapless quasiparticles charged with respect to the unbroken su(2)@xmath61 gauge group . in the gapless 2sc phase , such quasiparticles exist and the value of the debye screening mass is proportional to the density of states at the corresponding `` effective '' fermi surfaces . the 8-th gluon can probe the cooper - paired red and green quarks , as well as the unpaired blue quarks . after the traces over the color , the flavor and the nambu - gorkov indices are performed , the polarization tensor for the 8th gluon can be expressed as @xmath63 , \\label{pi88 } \\\\ \\pi_{88,b}^{\\mu\\nu}(p ) & = & \\frac{g^2t}{4}\\sum_n\\int \\frac{d^3 { \\mathbf k}}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\mbox{tr}_{\\rm d } \\left [ \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{3}^+(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu } g_{3}^+(k ' ) + \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{3}^-(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu}g_{3}^-(k ' ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left . \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{4}^+(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu}g_{4}^+(k ' ) + \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{4}^-(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu}g_{4}^-(k ' ) \\right ] . \\label{pi88b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after performing the traces over the color , the flavor and the nambu - gorkov indices , the diagonal components of the polarization tensor @xmath68 with @xmath69 have the form @xmath70.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath71 . apart from the diagonal elements , there are also nonzero off - diagonal elements , @xmath72 with @xmath73.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physical gluon fields in the 2sc / g2sc phase are the following linear combinations : @xmath74 and @xmath75 . these new fields , @xmath76 and @xmath77 describe two pairs of massive vector particles with well defined electomagnetic charges , @xmath78 . the components of the polarization tensor in the new basis read in the static limit , all four eigenvalues of the polarization tensor are degenerate . by making use of the definition in eq .

( [ m_d_4 ] ) and ( [ m_m_4 ] ) interpolate between the known results in the normal phase ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) and in the ideal 2sc phase ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) . the instability of off - diagonal gluons appears in the whole region of gapless 2sc phases ( with @xmath66 ) and even in some gapped 2sc phases ( with @xmath85 ) . it is noticed that the meissner screening mass square for the off - diagonal gluons decreases monotonously to zero when the mismatch increases from zero to @xmath86 , then goes to negative value with further increase of the mismatch in the gapped 2sc phase . however , the behavior of diagonal 8-th gluon s meissner mass square is quite different . it keeps as a constant in the gapped 2sc phase . in the gapless 2sc phase , all these five gluons meissner mass square are negative . it is not understood why gapless color superconducting phases exhibit chromomagnetic instability . it sounds quite strange especially in the g2sc phase , where it is the electrical neutrality not the color neutrality playing the essential role . it is a puzzle why the gluons can feel the instability by requiring the electrical neutrality on the system . in order to understand what is really going ` wrong ' with the homogeneous g2sc phase , we want to know whether there exists other instabilities except the chromomagnetic instability . for that purpose , we probe the g2sc phase using different external sources , e.g. , scalar and vector diquarks , mesons , vector current , and so on . here we report the most interesting result regarding the response of the g2sc phase to an external vector current @xmath87 , the time - component and spatial - components of this current correspond to the baryon number density and baryon current , respectively . from the linear response theory , the induced current and the external vector current is related by the response function @xmath88 , @xmath89 .\\ ] ] the trace here runs over the nambu - gorkov , flavor , color and dirac indices . the explicit form of vertices is @xmath90 . the explicit expression of the vector current response function takes the form of @xmath91 with @xmath92 , \\\\ % \\label{piv } \\pi_{v , b}^{\\mu\\nu}(p ) & = & \\frac{t}{2}\\sum_n\\int \\frac{d^3 { \\mathbf k}}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\mbox{tr}_{\\rm d } \\left [ \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left . \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{3}^+(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu } g_{3}^+(k ' ) + \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{3}^-(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu}g_{3}^-(k ' ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left . \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{4}^+(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu}g_{4}^+(k ' ) + \\gamma^{\\mu } g_{4}^-(k ) \\gamma^{\\nu}g_{4}^-(k ' ) \\right ] , % \\label{pivb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the trace is over the dirac space . comparing the explicit expression of @xmath93 with that of the 8-th gluon s self - energy @xmath94 , i.e. , eq . ( [ pi88 ] ) , it can be clearly seen that , @xmath93 and @xmath94 almost share the same expression , except the coefficients . this can be easily understood , because the color charge and color current carried by the 8-th gluon is proportional to the baryon number and baryon current , respectively . in the static long - wavelength ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) limit , the time - component and spatial component of @xmath93 give the baryon number susceptibility @xmath97 and baryon current susceptibility @xmath98 , respectively , @xmath99 in the g2sc phase , @xmath100 as well as @xmath98 become negative . this means that , except the chromomagnetic instability corresponding to broken generators of @xmath1 , and the instability of a net momentum for diquark pair , the g2sc phase is also unstable with respect to an external color neutral baryon current @xmath101 . the 8-th gluon s magnetic instability , the diquark momentum instability and the color neutral baryon current in the g2sc phase can be understood in one common physical picture . the g2sc phase exhibits a paramagnetic response to an external baryon current . naturally , the color current carried by the 8-th gluon , which differs from the baryon current by a color charge , also experiences the instability in the g2sc phase . the paramagnetic instability of the baryon current indicates that the quark can spontaneously obtain a momentum , because diquark carries twice of the quark momentum , it is not hard to understand why the g2sc phase is also unstable with respect to the response of a net diquark momentum . it is noticed that , the instability of @xmath101 will be induced by mismatch in all the asymmetric fermi pairing systems , including superfluid systems , where @xmath101 can be interpreted as particle current . the paramagnetic response to an external vector current naturally suggests that a vector current can be spontaneously generated in the system . the generated vector current behaves as a vector potential , which modifies the quark self - energy with a spatial vector condensate @xmath102 , and breaks the rotational symmetry of the system . it can also be understood that the quasiparticles in the gapless phase spontaneously obtain a superfluid velocity , and the ground state is in an anisotropic state . the quark propagator @xmath35 in eq .

( of course , it has to be carefully checked , whether all the instabilities in this us - loff window can be cured by off - diagonal gluons condensate in the charge neutral 2-flavor system . ) it is also noticed that in this us - loff window , the mismatch is close to the diquark gap , i.e. , @xmath134 . therefore it is interesting to check whether this us - loff window can be stabilized by a spin-1 condensate @xcite as proposed in ref . @xcite . in the charge neutral 2sc phase , though it is unlikely , we might have a lucky chance to cure the diagonal instability by the condensation of off - diagonal gluons . it is expected that this instability will show up in some constrained abelian asymmetric superfluidity system , e.g. , in the fixed number density case @xcite . it will be a new challenge for us to really solve this problem . we have seen that , except chromomagnetic instability corresponding to broken generators of @xmath1 , the g2sc phase is also unstable with respect to the external neutral baryon current . it is noticed that all the instabilities are induced by increasing the mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the cooper pairing . in order to understand the instability driven by mismatch , in the following , we give some general analysis . a superconductor will be eventually destroyed and goes to the normal fermi liquid state , so one natural question is : how an ideal bcs superconductor will be destroyed by increasing mismatch ? to answer how a superconductor will be destroyed , one has to firstly understand what is a superconductor . the superconducting phase is characterized by the order parameter @xmath135 , which is a complex scalar field and has the form of e.g. , for electrical superconductor , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 the amplitude and @xmath138 the phase of the gap order parameter or the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson . there are two ways to destroy a superconductor . one way is by driving the amplitude of the order parameter to zero . this way is bcs - like , because it mimics the behavior of a conventional superconductor at finite temperature , the gap amplitude monotonously drops to zero with the increase of temperature ; another way is non - bcs like , but berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-like @xcite , even if the amplitude of the order parameter is large and finite , superconductivity will be lost with the destruction of phase coherence , e.g. the phase transition from the @xmath144wave superconductor to the pseudogap state in high temperature superconductors @xcite . stimulating by the role of the phase fluctuation in the unconventional superconducting phase in condensed matter , we follow ref . @xcite to formulate the 2sc phase in the nonlinear realization framework in order to naturally take into account the contribution from the phase fluctuation or pseudo nambu - goldstone current . in the 2sc phase , the color symmetry @xmath145 breaks to @xmath146 . the generators of the residual @xmath53 symmetry h are @xmath147 with @xmath148 and the broken generators @xmath149 with @xmath150 . more precisely , the last broken generator is a combination of @xmath151 and the generator @xmath152 of the global @xmath153 symmetry of baryon number conservation , @xmath154 of generators of the global @xmath155 and local @xmath1 symmetry . the coset space @xmath156 is parameterized by the group elements @xmath157\\,\\,,\\ ] ] here @xmath158 and @xmath159 are five nambu - goldstone diquarks , and we have neglected the singular phase , which should include the information of the topological defects @xcite . operator @xmath160 is unitary , @xmath161 . introducing a new quark field @xmath162 , which is connected with the original quark field @xmath163 in eq . ( [ lagr-2sc ] ) in a nonlinear transformation form , @xmath164 and the charge - conjugate fields transform as @xmath165 in high-@xmath166 superconductor , this technique is called charge - spin separation , see ref . the advantage of transforming the quark fields is that this preserves the simple structure of the terms coupling the quark fields to the diquark sources , @xmath167 in mean - field approximation , the diquark source terms are proportional to @xmath168 introducing the new nambu - gorkov spinors @xmath169 the nonlinear realization of the original lagrangian density eq.([lagr-2sc ] ) takes the form of @xmath170 where @xmath171^{-1 } & \\phi^- \\\\ \\phi^+ & [ g^-_{0,nl}]^{-1 } \\end{array } \\right)\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] here the explicit form of the free propagator for the new quark field is @xmath172^{-1 } & = & i\\ , \\fsl{d } + { \\hat \\mu } \\ , \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_\\mu \\ , v^\\mu , % [ g^+_{0,nl}]^{-1 } & = & i\\ , \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu + { \\hat \\mu } \\ , \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_\\mu \\ , v^\\mu , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath173^{-1 } & = & i\\ , \\fsl{d}^t - { \\hat \\mu } \\ , \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_{\\mu } \\ , v_c^\\mu .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with the free propagator in the original lagrangian density , the free propagator in the non - linear realization framework naturally takes into account the contribution from the nambu - goldstone currents or phase fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath174 which is the @xmath175-dimensional maurer - cartan one - form introduced in ref . the linear order of the nambu - goldstone currents @xmath176 and @xmath177 has the explicit form of @xmath178 the lagrangian density eq . ( [ lagr - nl ] ) for the new quark fields looks like an extension of the theory in ref . @xcite for high-@xmath166 superconductor to non - abelian system , except that here we neglected the singular phase contribution from the topologic defects . the advantage of the non - linear realization framework eq . ( [ lagr - nl ] ) is that it can naturally take into account the contribution from the phase fluctuations or nambu - goldstone currents . the task left is to correctly solve the ground state by considering the phase fluctuations . the free energy @xmath179 can be evaluated directly and it takes the form of @xmath180^{-1 } ) + \\frac{\\phi^2}{4 g_d}. \\label{free - energy - ng}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to evaluate the ground state of @xmath179 as a function of mismatch is tedious and still under progress . in the following we just give a brief discussion on the nambu - goldstone current generation state @xcite , one - plane wave loff state @xcite , as well as the gluon phase @xcite . if we expand the thermodynamic potential @xmath179 of the non - linear realization form in terms of the nambu - goldstone currents , we will naturally have the nambu - goldstone currents generation in the system with the increase of mismatch , i.e. , @xmath181 and/or @xmath182 at large @xmath183 . this is an extended version of the nambu - goldstone current generation state proposed in a minimal gapless model in ref . @xcite . from eq . ( [ lagr - nl ] ) , we can see that @xmath184 contributes to the baryon current . @xmath182 indicates a baryon current generation or 8-th gluon condensate in the system , it is just the one - plane wave loff state . this has been discussed in sec . [ sec - usloff ] . the other four nambu - goldstone currents generation @xmath181 indicates other color current generation in the system , and is equivalent to the gluon phase described in ref . @xcite . we do not argue whether the system will exprience a gluon condensate phase or nambu - goldstone currents generation state . we simply think they are equivalent . in fact , the gauge fields and the nambu - goldstone currents share a gauge covariant form as shown in the free propogator . however , we prefer to using nambu - goldstone currents generation than the gluon condensate in the gnjl model . as mentioned in sec . [ sec - gnjl ] , in the gnjl model , all the information from unkown nonperturbative gluons are hidden in the diquark gap parameter @xmath185 . the gauge fields in the lagrangian density are just external fields , they only play the role of probing the system , but do not contribute to the property of the color superconducting phase . therefore , there is no gluon free - energy in the gnjl model , it is not clear how to derive the gluon condensate in this model . in order to investigate the problem in a fully self - consistent way , one has to use the ambitious framework by using the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite including diquark degree of freedom @xcite or in the framework of effective theory of high - density quark matter as in ref . @xcite . except the chromomagnetic instability , the g2sc phase also exhibits a paramagnetic response to the perturbation of an external baryon current . this suggests a baryon current can be spontaneously generated in the g2sc phase , and the quasiparticles spontaneously obtain a superfluid velocity . the spontaneously generated baryon current breaks the rotational symmetry of the system , and it resembles the one - plane wave loff state . we further describe the 2sc phase in the nonlinear realization framework , and show that each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding pseudo nambu - goldstone current . we show this nambu - goldstone currents generation state can naturally cover the gluon phase as well as the one - plane wave loff state . we also point out that , when charge neutrality condition is required , there exists a narrow unstable loff ( us - loff ) window , where not only off - diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8-th gluon can not avoid the magnetic instability . the diagonal gluon s magnetic instability in this us - loff window can not be cured by off - diagonal gluon condensate in color superconducting phase . more interestingly , this us - loff window will also show up in some constrained abelian asymmetric superfluid system . the us - loff window brings us a new challenge . we need new thoughts on understanding how a bcs supercondutor will be eventually destroyed by increasing the mismatch , we also need to develop new methods to really resolve the instability problem . some methods developed in unconventional superconductor field , e.g. , high-@xmath166 superconductor , might be helpful . till now , the results on instabilities are based on mean - field ( mf ) approximation . the bcs theory at mf can describe strongly coherent or rigid superconducting state very well . however , as we pointed out in @xcite , with the increase of mismatch , the low degrees of freedom in the system have been changed . for example , the gapless quasi - particle excitations in the gapless phase , and the small meissner mass square of the off - diagonal gluons around @xmath186 . this indicates that these quasi - quarks and gluons become low degrees of freedom in the system , their fluctuations become more important . in order to correctly describe the system , the [隐藏] degrees of freedom should be taken into account properly . the work toward this direction is still in progress . the author thanks m. alford , f.a . bais , k. fukushima , e. gubankova , m. hashimoto , t. hatsuda , l.y . hong , w.v . liu , m. mannarelli , t. matsuura , y. nambu , k. rajagopal , h.c . ren , d. rischke , t. schafer , a. schmitt , i. shovkovy , d. t. son , m. tachibana , z.tesanovic , x. g. wen , z. y. weng , f. wilczek and k. yang for valuable discussions . the work is supported by the japan society for the promotion of science fellowship program . r. rapp , t. schfer , e. v. shuryak and m. velkovsky , phys . lett . * 81 * , 53 ( 1998 ) ;

however , the relative merits of normalized versus unnormalized tuners are still somewhat controversial . another alternative is to use a time - varying @xmath9 , as is done in least - squares tuning . in [ sec : acceleration ] we present a tuner that sets the second derivative of @xmath0 , and in [ sec : covariance ] the effects of a white noise @xmath5 on the performance of the two algorithms are compared . then we show some simulations and make concluding remarks . classical tuners are such that the _ velocity _ of adaptation ( the first derivative of the parameters ) is set proportional to the regressor and to the prediction error @xmath21 . we propose to set the _ acceleration _ of the parameters : @xmath22 notice that the the formula above is implementable ( using @xmath23 integrators ) if measurement error is absent , because the unknown @xmath24 appears only in scalar product with @xmath25 . choose another function of lyapunovian inspiration : @xmath26 taking derivatives along the trajectories of gives @xmath27 integrating @xmath28 we obtain @xmath29 which leads immediately to the desired properties : @xmath30 the slow variation property @xmath31 follows without the need for normalization , and now we obtain @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 as before . we might regard @xmath34 as a modified error , which can be used in the stability analysis of a detectable or `` tunable '' adaptive system via an output - injection argument ; see @xcite . a generalization of is @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 constant , symmetric , positive - definite @xmath38 matrices such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the properties of tuner , which can be obtained using the positive - definite function @xmath41 in the same manner as before , are @xmath42 we now consider the effects on the expected value and covariance of @xmath43 of the presence of a measurement error . the assumptions are that @xmath11 is a white noise with zero average and covariance @xmath44 and that @xmath45 are given , deterministic data . for comparison purposes , first consider what happens when the conventional tuner is applied to in the presence of measurement error @xmath5 : @xmath46 the solution to the equation above can be written in terms of @xmath47 s state transition matrix @xmath48 as follows @xmath49 hence @xmath50 because @xmath51 by assumption . here the notation @xmath52 , denoting the expectation with respect to the random variable @xmath5 , is used to emphasize that the stochastic properties of @xmath25 are not under consideration . the conclusion is that @xmath43 will converge to zero in average as fast as @xmath53 does . the well - known persistency of excitation conditions on @xmath54 are sufficient for the latter to happen . to study the second moment of the parameter error , write @xmath55 the covariance of @xmath43 can be written as the sum of four terms . the first is deterministic . the second term @xmath56 because @xmath11 has zero mean , and the third term is likewise zero . the fourth term @xmath57 where fubini s theorem and the fact @xmath58 were used . performing the integration and adding the first and fourth terms results in @xmath59 this equation can be given the following interpretation : for small @xmath60 , when @xmath53 is close to the identity , the covariance of @xmath43 remains close to @xmath61 , the outer product of the error in the initial guess of the parameters with itself . as @xmath62 , which will happen if @xmath54 is persistently exciting , @xmath63 tends to @xmath64 . this points to a compromise between higher convergence speeds and lower steady - state parameter error , which require respectively larger and smaller values of the gain @xmath9 . algorithms that try for the best of both worlds parameter convergence in the mean - square sense often utilize time - varying , decreasing gains ; an example is the least - squares algorithm . we shall now attempt a similar analysis for the acceleration tuner applied to , which results in the differential equation @xmath65 let @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , each @xmath69 is a function of @xmath70 unless otherwise noted , and the dot signifies derivative with respect to the first argument . if @xmath71 , @xmath72 following the same reasoning used for the velocity tuner , one concludes that @xmath73 and that @xmath74 however the properties of the acceleration and velocity tuners are not yet directly comparable because the right - hand side of does not lend itself to immediate integration . to obtain comparable results , we employ the ungainly but easily verifiable formula , @xmath75 ' '' '' valid for arbitrary scalars @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and make the [ [ simplifying - assumption ] ] simplifying assumption : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + for @xmath78 , and 3 , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are scalars and @xmath81 is the @xmath82 identity matrix . premultiplying by @xmath83 $ ] , postmultiplying by @xmath83^\\top$ ] , integrating from 0 to @xmath60 , and using the simplifying assumption gives formula . @xmath84 ' '' '' taking @xmath85 in , @xmath86 results positive - semidefinite , therefore @xmath87 the combination of and shows that @xmath88 can be increased without affecting @xmath24 s steady - state covariance . on the other hand , to decrease the covariance we need to increase @xmath89 , which roughly speaking means increasing damping in . since @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be increased without affecting the stability properties shown in [ sec : acceleration ] , a better transient @xmath90 steady - state performance compromise might be achievable with the acceleration tuner than with the velocity tuner , at least in the case when @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath37 are `` scalars . '' notice that @xmath93 by construction . [ [ approximate - analysis ] ] approximate analysis : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the derivation of inequality does not involve any approximations , and therefore provides an upper bound on @xmath94 , valid independently of @xmath54 . a less conservative estimate of the integral in can be obtained by replacing @xmath95 by its average value @xmath96 in the definition of @xmath86 in . this approximation seems reasonable because @xmath86 appears inside an integral , but calls for more extensive simulation studies . to obtain a useful inequality , we require @xmath97 ; namely , using the schur complement @xmath98 or , using the simplifying assumption and [隐藏] @xmath95 by its approximation @xmath96 @xmath99 suppose further that @xmath100 . looking for the least conservative estimate , we pick @xmath101 , the least value of @xmath76 that keeps @xmath97 . thus @xmath102 with @xmath103 \\bar{m}_1 \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}{\\phi}^\\top_{11}(t,0 ) \\\\ { \\phi}^\\top_{12}(t,0 ) \\end{smallmatrix}\\right]}{4m_1 ^ 2 m_2m_3r(1+\\mu_2 ) -r}.$ ] taking @xmath104 we repeat the previous , exact result . for large positive values of @xmath77 the first term of the right - hand side of tends to @xmath105 , which indicates that the steady - state covariance of the parameter error decreases when the signal @xmath25 increases in magnitude , and that it can be made smaller via appropriate choices of the gains @xmath88 and @xmath106 . the situation for the accelerating tuner is hence much more favorable than for the conventional one . the simulations in this section compare the behavior of the accelerating tuner with those of the gradient tuner and of a normalized gradient one . all simulations were done in open - loop , with the regressor a two - dimensional signal , and without measurement noise . figure [ fig : step ] shows the values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively when @xmath25 is a two - dimensional step signal . in figure [ fig : sin ] the regressor is a sinusoid , in figure [ fig : sia ] an exponentially increasing sinusoid , and in figure [ fig : prb ] a pseudorandom signal generated using matlab . no effort was made to optimize the choice of gain matrices ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath37 were all chosen equal to the identity ) , and the effect of measurement noise was not considered . the performance of the accelerating tuner is comparable , and sometimes superior , to that of the other tuners . = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in other ideas related to the present one are replacing the integrator in with a positive - real transfer function @xcite , and using high - order tuning ( @xcite ) . high - order tuning generates as outputs @xmath0 as well as its derivatives up to a given order ( in this sense we might consider the present algorithm a second - order tuner ) , but unlike the accelerating tuner requires derivatives of @xmath25 up to that same order . we expect that accelerating tuners will find application in adaptive control of nonlinear systems and maybe in dealing with the topological incompatibility known as the `` loss of stabilizability problem '' in the adaptive control literature . the stochastic analysis in [ sec : covariance ] indicates that the performance and convergence properties of the accelerating tuner , together with its moderate computational complexity , may indeed make it a desirable tool for adaptive filtering applications . it seems that a better transient @xmath90 steady - state performance compromise is achievable with the accelerating tuner than with the velocity tuner . to verify this conjecture , a study of convergence properties of the accelerating tuner and their relation with the persistence of excitation conditions is in order , as well as more extensive simulations in the presence of measurement noise .", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_354", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "in adaptive control and recursive parameter estimation one often needs to adjust recursively an esti..."}

Been looking at the staples website and HP site, couldn't find info on which version of OS is installed on the system. Any suggestions? Not sure if I could deal with Win 10 (spy on me and patch when MS says) Home version though. how does this compare to this one? I got the i7 directly from HP awhile back. It had very little bloatware on it and set up extremely easy. I took the case off to see how easy it'd be to add an HD and.... Not terribly. But I didn't really need to so it was no big deal. Pretty impressed so far. Looks like that Dell deal has expired. You most likely can not stop the spying on you. I do not buy you are not spied on in Windows 7. As to the patching when they want. Windows 10 is not nearly as bad at that as Windows 7. I have had 10 for some time now. Installed it while it was still free upgrade fairly soon after it started that. Only about twice did it install and restart when I was using it. [隐藏] you walk away and leave it on sometimes it will do that. I quite like Windows 10 and is seems to work better for me than 7. When you first install it it might be problematic. Seems to take up to two weeks to simmer down. I could not force my 4k to work for the first week or two when upgrading to Windows 10. After a week or a bit more I could but had to specify the 4k settings manually. Once I did that it would recognize my 4k monitor. By the way the video card is not a 4k video card. Most will work on 4k if you manually install it at 26 or 30 hz. For 60 you need the correct cable and a better card. Unfortunately most TV's do not have the best input for 4k. The processor itself cost $300. So yes it is a good deal if you want a powerful desktop for gaming or something. Makes more sense to me to add an SSD for the Operating System. Optane Memory speeds up a hard drive but not nearly as much as an SSD. Seems to me for this price not adding an SSD would be foolish. It makes the Desktop so much faster. The second one down has 24 GB of memory. At least now it does perhaps it did not originally. Last edited by SteveA7911 July 15, 2018 at 07:44 PM. Not too familiar with these small form factors. Is the power supply not the standard size? And is it even possible to throw in a short 7\" long graphics card? I have a nice 450W Corsair PSU just lying around and would like to put it in this HP as well to make it a gaming rig. Power supply is 310 volts and it would be difficult to replace it as the power on the MB is uncommon. 75 Watts is the max for a Graphics board. It only has two connections for boards. One large one and a small one. When you ask them a question they do not really answer it. Their main page is almost completely useless describing the computer. The Motherboard does have a M1 for a SSD. However they have nothing for a second SATA drive. The Motherboard does. So it might be possible to add one anyway. Power would require a divider for power and another SATA cable. Last edited by SteveA7911 July 15, 2018 at 08:05 PM. Any idea how the ram would come on the one with 12gb ram?

It's been a few years since I've been to one, but I'm really looking forward to it. Beyond the opportunity to network and refresh our excitement about Rails, we've been perusing the schedule and found some things that piqued our interest! We know that the next version of Rails is coming up and RailsConf is a great place to learn about, and get a sneak peek at, some of the new features. [隐藏] there will probably be discussion in general about the next version and DHH will probably talk about it in his keynote, we're interested to hear more about how attributes and type casting will be changing as well as how callbacks will be changing. We always look forward to hearing about the progression and evolution of the framework we love! While it's not the most glamourous topic, process is an important part of software development. As Velocity Labs has begun growing, we've been evaluating and refining how we work. Recently, we've defined some of our processes, including a branching strategy, built-in code review cycle, continuous integration testing, issue tracking and release deployment process. In particular, the code review cycle is now an integral part of how we work, but we know that there's always room for improvement. That's why we're intrigued to learn how we can improve and implement a stronger code review culture, from Derek Prior of thoughtbot. There's also a session on using ECMAScript 6, in your Rails app, which sounds very interesting. And then, if you're tired of the JS framework hype, you can get a side-by-side comparison of AngularJS, Ember.js and Rails server-side JS to find out why your front-end framework is overkill.

{"question": "上下文中的'事实上'指的是什么？", "answer": "实际上", "context": "the einstein field equation has two parameters , the cosmological constant @xmath9 and the gravitational constant @xmath10 . in 1998 , the discovery that the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the dark energy ( de ) from the type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) observations ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) greatly astonished the world . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( peiris et al . 2003 ; spergel et al . 2007 ) , combined with more accurate sn ia data ( riess et al . 2004 ) indicates that the universe is almost spatially flat and the dark energy accounts for about @xmath11 of the total content of the universe . however , we know little about the nature of dark energy except for its negative pressure . observations strongly favour a small and positive value of the effective cosmological constant at the present epoch . among many possible alternatives , the simplest and theoretically appealing possibility of dark energy is the energy density stored on the vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe i. e. , @xmath12 . the variable cosmological constant ( overduin and cooperstock 1998 ; sahni and starobinsky 2000 ; peebles and ratra 2003 ; padmanabhan 2003 , 2008 ; freese 2005 ) is one of the phenomenological ways to explain the dark energy problem , because it is a straightforward modification of the cosmological constant @xmath9 which enable itself to be compatible with observations . the problem in this approach is to determine the right dependence of @xmath9 upon scale factor @xmath13 or @xmath14 . motivated by dimensional grounds with quantum cosmology , the variation of cosmological term as @xmath15 is considered by chen and wu ( 1990 ) . however , several ans@xmath16tz have been proposed in which the @xmath9-term decays with time ( gasperini 1988 ; berman 1990 , 1991 , 2001 ; ratra and peebles 1988 ; abdussattar and vishwakarma 1996 ) . several authors have recently studied the time dependent cosmological constant in different contexts ( singh et al . 2007 ; pradhan and kumhar 2009 ; pradhan and jotania 2010 , 2011 ; pradhan 2011 ; amirhashchi et al . 2011a , b ; pradhan et al . 2011 , 2013a , b , c ) . + the other constant of einstein s field equations i.e. the gravitational constant ( @xmath10 ) plays the role of coupling constant between geometry and matter . recent observations also incertitude the stability of fundamental constants and `` equivalence principle '' of general relativity . dirac ( 1937a , b ) was first to introduce the time variation of the gravitational constant @xmath10 in his large number hypothesis and since then it has been used frequently in numerous modifications of general theory of relativity . @xmath10 has many interesting consequences in astrophysics . it is shown that g - varying cosmology is consistent with whatsoever cosmological observations available at present ( canuto and narlikar 1980 ) . several authors have recently investigated and discussed the time dependent @xmath9 and @xmath10 in different contexts ( saha 2001a ; singh et al . 2008 ; singh and kale 2009 ; amirhashchi et al . 2012 ; yadav et al . 2012 ; chawla et al . 2012 ) . recently , yadav and sharma ( 2013 ) and yadav ( 2012 ) have discussed about transit universe in bianchi type - v space - time with variable g and @xmath9 . + anisotropic bianchi type - i universe , which is more general than frw universe , plays a significant role to understand the phenomenon like formation of galaxies in early universe . theoretical arguments as well as the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) support the existence of anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one . motivated by the above discussions , in this paper , we propose to study homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi type - i transit cosmological models with time dependent gravitational and cosmological `` constants '' . the paper is organized as follows . in sect . @xmath17 , the metric and basic equations have been presented . section @xmath18 deals with solutions of field equations . in sect . @xmath19 , the results and discussions are described . the statefinder diagnostic has been discussed in sect . finally , conclusions are summarized in the last sect . @xmath21 . we consider the space - time metric of the spatially homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi - i of the form @xmath22 where a(t ) , b(t ) and c(t ) are the metric functions of cosmic time t. + einstein field equations with time - dependent @xmath10 and @xmath9 are given by @xmath23 where the symbols have their usual meaning . + for a perfect fluid , the stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the matter density , p is the thermodynamics pressure and @xmath27 is the fluid four - velocity vector of the fluid satisfying the condition @xmath28 in the field equations ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath9 accounts for vacuum energy with its energy density @xmath29 and pressure @xmath30 satisfying the equation of state @xmath31 the critical density and the density parameters for matter and cosmological constant are , respectively , defined as @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 we observe that the density parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are singular when h = 0 . + in a comoving system of coordinates , the field eqs . ( [ eq2 ] ) for the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) with ( [ eq3 ] ) read as @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 the covariant divergence of eq .

( [ eq9])@xmath55([eq11 ] ) @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants of integration . finally , using @xmath72 , we write the metric functions from eqs . ( [ eq25])@xmath55([eq27 ] ) in explicit form as @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where constants @xmath76 and @xmath77 satisfy the fallowing two relations : @xmath78 in the particular case @xmath79{d_{1}d_{2 } } , \\indent l_{2 } = \\sqrt[3]{d_{1}^{-1}d_{3 } } , \\indent l_{3 } = \\sqrt[3]{(d_{2}d_{3})^{-1}},\\ ] ] and @xmath80 now , the metric functions can be determined as functions of cosmic time t if the average scale factor is known . hence , following ( yadav and sharma 2013 ; yadav 2012 ; pradhan et al . 2013d ) we consider the _ ansatz _ for the scale factor , where increase in term of time evolution is @xmath81 this _ ansatz _ generalizes the one proposed in ( pradhan 2013 ; saha et al . 2012 ; pradhan and amirhashchi 2011 ) . this choice of scale factor yields a time - dependent deceleration parameter ( see eq . ( [ eq47 ] ) ) such that before dark energy era ( cosmological constant ) , the corresponding solution gives inflation and radiation / matter dominance era with subsequent transition from deceleration to acceleration . thus , our choice of scale factor is physically acceptable . the motivation for such consideration is due to observational fact that the universe has accelerated expansion at present as observed in recent observations of type ia supernova ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; tonry et al . 2003 ; clocchiatti et al . 2006 ) and cmb anisotropies ( de bernardis et al . 2002 ; bennett et al . 2003 ; hanany et al . 2000 ) and decelerated expansion in the past . it is well established the transition redshift from decelerating expansion to accelerated expansion is about @xmath82 . now for a universe which was decelerating in past and accelerating at the present time , the dp must show signature flipping ( padmanabhan and roychowdhury 2003 ; amendola 2003 ; riess et al . this theme motivates to choose such scale factor ( [ eq34 ] ) that yields a time dependent dp ( [ eq47 ] ) . + using eq .

( [ eq21 ] ) , the deceleration parameter is computed as @xmath105 from eq . ( [ eq47 ] ) , we observe that @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 . it is observed that for @xmath110 , our model is evolving from decelerating phase to accelerating phase . also , recent observations of sne ia , expose that the present universe is accelerating and the value of dp lies on some place in the range @xmath111 . it follows that in our derived model , one can choose the value of dp consistent with the observation . figure @xmath112 depicts the variation of deceleration parameter ( @xmath113 ) versus cosmic time which gives the behaviour of @xmath113 as in accelerating phase at present epoch for different values of @xmath114 which is consistent with recent observations of type ia supernovae ( riess et al . 1998 , 2004 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; tonry et al . 2003 ; clocchiatti et al . 2006 ) . + vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 from above eq . ( [ eq47 ] ) , present value of deceleration parameter can be estimated as @xmath118 where where @xmath119 is present value of hubble s parameter and @xmath120 is the age of universe at present epoch . recent observations show that the deceleration parameter of the universe is in the range @xmath121 i.e @xmath122 . for @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath123 which is similar to the observed value of dp at present epoch ( cunha et al . therefore , we restrict the values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 such that the condition @xmath2 is satisfied for graphical representations of the physical parameters . as a representative case , we have considered four values of @xmath126 as ( 0.25 , 0.9259259260 ) , ( 0.50 , 0.1.851851852 ) , ( 0.75 , 2.77777778 ) and ( 3 , 11.11111111 ) respectively for graphic presentation of figures 1@xmath558 . + from eqs . ( [ eq42 ] ) and ( [ eq44 ] ) we observe that the spatial volume is zero at @xmath127 and the expansion scalar is infinite , which show that the universe starts evolving with zero volume at @xmath127 which is big bang scenario . from eqs . ( [ eq35])@xmath55([eq37 ] ) , we observe that the spatial scale factors are zero at the initial epoch @xmath127 and hence the model has a point type singularity ( maccallum 1971 ) . we observe that proper volume increases with time . + from eq . ( [ eq45 ] ) , we observe that at late time when @xmath128 , @xmath129 . thus , our model has transition from initial anisotropy to isotropy at present epoch which is in good harmony with current observations . figure @xmath17 depicts the variation of anisotropic parameter ( @xmath98 ) versus cosmic time @xmath14 . from the figure , we observe that @xmath98 decreases with time and tends to zero as @xmath128 . thus , the observed isotropy of the universe can be achieved in our model at present epoch . + it is important to note here that @xmath130 spread out to be constant . therefore the model of the universe goes up homogeneity and matter is dynamically negligible near the origin . this is in good agreement with the result already given by collins ( 1977 ) . vs time @xmath14 for @xmath131 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath131 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath131 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath5 ] vs time @xmath14 for @xmath131 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath5 ] , @xmath36 , @xmath136 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath5 ] , @xmath36 , @xmath136 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath5 ] , @xmath36 , @xmath136 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath5 ] , @xmath36 , @xmath136 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath5 ] , @xmath36 , @xmath136 vs time @xmath14 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath137 , @xmath5,width=264,height=264 ] using eq .

( [ eq57 ] ) that @xmath170 approaches to one for sufficiently large time independent to @xmath171 . figures @xmath21 and @xmath172 plot the variation of density parameters for matter ( @xmath35 ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath36 ) versus @xmath14 respectively . from these figures it is clear that the universe is dominated by matter in early stage of evolution whereas the universe is dominated by dark energy ( cosmological constant @xmath9 ) at present epoch . figure @xmath173 plots the variation of total energy parameter ( @xmath136 ) versus cosmic time @xmath14 . from the fig . @xmath173 , we observe that @xmath174 at late time for arbitrary value of @xmath171 . this is in good agreement with the observational results ( spergel 2003 ) . + it is worth mentioned here that data in favor of nonzero cosmological constant involves the estimates of the age of the universe as compared with the estimates of the hubble parameter . with taking into account uncertainties in models the best fit to guarantee consensus between all observational constraints ( krauss and turner 1995 ; ostriker and steinhardt 1995 ; bahcall et al . 1999 ) is @xmath175 @xmath176 where @xmath177 , and the critical density @xmath178 , which correspond to @xmath169 , is given by @xmath179 which is in good agreement with observations as discussed in introduction . confrontation of models with observations in cosmology as well as the inflationary paradigm , compellingly favor treating the cosmological constant as a variable dynamical quantity . + for different values of @xmath125 and @xmath124 , we can generate a class of models of the universe in bianchi type - i space - time with time dependent gravitational and cosmological constants . we observe that for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we obtain a class of transit models of the universe from early decelerated to present accelerating phase . for @xmath180 and [隐藏] , we obtain accelerating models at present epoch . for examples : + * if we put @xmath134 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we obtain @xmath181 . in this case , we obtain the expressions for different physical and geometric quantities as obtained by pradhan et al . ( 2013d ) . thus , our investigations generalize the recent results of pradhan et al . ( 2013e ) . * if we put @xmath134 and @xmath5 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we obtain @xmath182 . in this case , we obtain the expressions for different physical parameters and geometric quantities by putting @xmath134 and @xmath5 in eqs . ( [ eq42])@xmath55([eq57 ] ) . figure @xmath183 depicts the variation of dp with cosmic time for different values of ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) . from fig . @xmath183 , we observe that for @xmath184 and @xmath5 the model has a transition from very early decelerated phase to the present accelerating phase . we have already mentioned in sect . @xmath18 that in such type of universe , the dp must show signature interchange ( padmanabhan & roychowdhury 2003 ; amendola 2003 ; riess et al . 2001 ) . the variation of energy density , cosmological constant and density parameters versus cosmic time @xmath14 have been shown in figs . @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 respectively . * if we put @xmath137 and @xmath5 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we obtain @xmath188 . in this case , we obtain the expressions for different physical parameters and geometric quantities as usual . from fig . @xmath183 , we observe that for @xmath189 and @xmath5 , the model has transition from early decelerated phase to the present accelerating phase . the variation of energy density , cosmological constant and density parameters versus cosmic time @xmath14 have been shown in figs . @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 respectively . the present value @xmath193 of the deceleration parameter obtained from observations are @xmath194 ( schuecker et al . studies of galaxy from redshift surveys provide a value of @xmath195 , with an upper limit of @xmath196 ( schuecker et al . recent observations show that the deceleration parameter of the universe is in the range @xmath121 i.e @xmath122 . first , we set @xmath137 and @xmath5 in eq . ( [ eq48 ] ) , we obtain @xmath197 . this value is very near to the observed value of dp ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) at present epoch ( cunha et al . 2009 ) . secondly , if we choose @xmath137 and @xmath5 , we observe that all the values of physical and geometric parameters are easily integrable . hence this case is important from physical aspects . * if we put @xmath198 and @xmath5 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we obtain @xmath199 . in this case , we obtain the expressions for different physical parameters and geometric quantities as usual . from fig . @xmath183 , one can see that for @xmath198 and @xmath5 the model is accelerating at present epoch . the other physical parameters have the same property as already discussed . * if we put @xmath6 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we obtain @xmath200 . in this case the universe has non - singular origin which seems reasonable to envision the dynamics of future universe . in this case , we found that energy density ( @xmath26 ) is always negative and hence it is an unphysical case . we plan to work out a physically viable non - singular model in forthcoming paper . the various cosmological observational data support the @xmath9 cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) model , in which the cosmological constant @xmath9 plays a role of dark energy in general relativity . at the current stage , the @xmath9cdm model is considered to be a standard cosmological model . sahni et al . ( 2003 ) have introduced a pair of parameters @xmath201 , called statefinder parameters . in fact , trajectories in the @xmath201 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behavior . the statefinder parameters can effectively differentiate between different form of dark energy and provide simple diagnosis regarding whether a particular model fits into the basic observational data . the above statefinder diagnostic pair has the following form : @xmath202 to differentiate among different form of dark energy . here @xmath44 is the hubble parameter and @xmath113 is the deceleration parameter . the two parameters @xmath201 are dimensionless and are geometrical since they are derived from the cosmic scale factor @xmath203 alone , though one can reproduce them in terms of the parameters of dark energy and dark matter . this pair provides information about dark energy in a model@xmath55independent way , that is , it categorizes dark energy in the context of back - ground geometry only which is not dependent on theory of gravity . hence , geometrical variables are universal . + for our model , the parameters @xmath201 can be explicitly written in terms of @xmath14 as @xmath204 @xmath205}.\\ ] ] from eqs . ( [ eq59 ] ) and ( [ eq60 ] ) we observe that @xmath206 is negative when @xmath207 . it is observed that the universe starts from an einstein static era ( @xmath208 ) and goes to the @xmath9cdm model ( @xmath209 ) . in this paper , we have presented a new class of models of accelerating universe and transit universe with gravitational coupling @xmath7 and cosmological term @xmath8 in the framework of general relativity . the models represent expanding , shearing and non - rotating universe . the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 diverge at the initial singularity . there is a point type singularity ( maccallum 1971 ) at @xmath127 in the models . the rate of expansion slows down and finally tends to zero at @xmath140 . the pressure , energy density and cosmological term @xmath9 become negligible whereas the scale factors , gravitational constant @xmath10 and spatial volume become infinite as @xmath128 . the nature of decaying vacuum energy density @xmath8 in our derived models is supported by recent cosmological observations . we observe that our derived models are isotropic at present epoch which is in good agreement with the current observations . + for different choice of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we can generate a class of viable cosmological models of the universe in bianchi type space - time as well as in frw universe . for example : if we set @xmath134 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we find @xmath210 which is used by pradhan and amirhashchi ( 2011 ) in studying the accelerating dark energy models in bianchi type - v space - time and pradhan et al . ( 2012a ) in studying bianchi type - i in scalar - tensor theory of gravitation . if we set @xmath211 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we find @xmath212 which is utilized by amirhashchi et al . ( 2011b ) in studying interacting two - fluid scenario for dark energy in frw universe . if we set @xmath213 in eq . ( [ eq34 ] ) , we find @xmath214 which is exercised by pradhan et al . ( 2012b ) to study the dark energy model in bianchi type-@xmath215 universe . it is observed that such models are also in good harmony with current observations . the present work generalizes the the recent works ( pradhan et al . 2013c , e ) . + we observe that our models approach to @xmath9cdm model . so , from the statefinder parameter @xmath201 the behaviour of different stages of the evolution of the universe has been generated . + in summary , the solutions described in this paper may be useful for better understanding of the characteristic of bianchi type -

The complaint says Snyder refused several requests to leave and was escorted out of the hospital by a security guard. West Virginia's tax revenue slide is continuing as October's collections fell about $8 million below estimates. Deputy revenue secretary Mark Muchow tells media outlets that collections of personal income, consumer sales and business and occupation taxes were all below estimates. Personal income and consumer sales taxes are the state's biggest sources of tax revenue. Natural gas production boosted severance tax collections above estimates. But Muchow says it wasn't enough to offset the declines. The Mingo County Commission is expected to name a new county prosecutor and county commissioner this week. Former prosecutor Michael Sparks and former Commissioner David Baisden resigned in October after they were charged in separate cases stemming from a corruption probe. WSAZ-TV reports that the commission interviewed candidates to replace Sparks and Baisden on Monday. Commissioners plan to name a new prosecutor and magistrate at their meeting on Wednesday. A judge called the inner workings of the Gene Spadaro Juvenile Center “concerning” after receiving a report from a court monitor for the Adjudicated Juvenile Rehabilitation Review Commission. The Commission was established in June of 2011 to examine the operations and programs of the Division of Juvenile Services facilities across the state. Cindy Largent-Hill is a member of the commission and visited the Spadaro Juvenile Center in Fayette County Monday. Judge Omar Aboulhosn heard what may be the last evidence in the case filed by [隐藏] Justice against the Division of Juvenile Services. Mountain State asked three juvenile residents to testify in an evidentiary hearing Tuesday in Kanawha County Circuit Court. B.M., identified only by his initials for the court, is a juvenile resident of the Sam Perdue Juvenile Center in Princeton. He is one of the 25 residents relocated after Aboulhosn order the closure of the Harriet B. Jones Treatment Center in Salem over the summer. In 1960, then-Senator and Presidential Candidate John F. Kennedy visited McDowell County, West Virginia and forged a bond with those living in the state's southern coalfields. It was a victory in West Virginia's Democratic primary that helped confirm his broad appeal to the rest of America. After winning the presidential election, Kennedy exposed the rest of the country to the perils of poverty that faced the region. In this article, USA Today reports on the way Kennedy's assassination has resonated with those living in southern West Virginia, the way things were then, and how they are now. A hearing in Kanawha County Circuit Court will determine whether or not juvenile residents of state facilities will see a difference in the way grievances are handled and an increase in educational opportunities. Mercer County Judge Omar Aboulhosn will be presented a proposed agreement between the Division of Juvenile Services and Mountain State Justice, a Charleston based public interest law firm whose lawsuit against the division resulted in the closure of the Salem Industrial Home for Youth and later the Harriet B. Jones Treatment Center. Former Arkansas governor and Fox News host Mike Huckabee made a stop in West Virginia to help energize the state Republican Party during a fundraiser Friday night. An evening that started with state GOP Chairman Conrad Lucas poking fun at an array of federal indictments coming from Mingo County, all against Democratic leaders, transitioned to focus on what Huckabee called the true message of the Republican party—valuing every life based on inherent worth given by God and not status. The Washington Post breaks down West Virginia's transition from being a state that has traditionally favored Democrats to becoming more and more likely to vote Republican. The West Virginia Public Service Commission got an earful from Eastern Panhandle electric customers unhappy with Potomac Edison’s billing practices during a public hearing Wednesday evening and Thursday morning in Shepherdstown, W.Va. Customers are upset because last winter and spring they received estimated monthly bills that were much higher than normal. In some cases the electric company did estimated readings several months in a row. Delegate Stephen Skinner (D-Jefferson) was among those who spoke during the hearing. Only days into the 2013 Legislative session, it became obvious to those eyeing the halls of the state Capitol it would be the year of Education Reform. With the passage of the governor’s bill, immediate steps were taken to improve student achievement, but some steps couldn’t be implemented so quickly. Legislators are still learning how they can help improve early childhood education in West Virginia. How much do we know about drilling horizontal wells? The Horizontal Well Control Act of 2011 required studies be conducted to gain a more profound understanding of all that's entailed in the natural gas drilling that's sweeping northern West Virginia. Those reports are coming due, and legislators are hearing from scientists who have been looking into the matter. Two major reports are being discussed in Charleston this week. One looks at air and noise pollution, while another considers water use related to Horizontal Well drilling. A company involved in the problematic federal health care exchange website has a contract to design a system to manage West Virginia state government accounts. CGI Group subsidiary CGI Federal is the developer of the complex U.S. government website that's been hit by technical problems, resulting in long waits for Americans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Can the DOH take over the state turnpike? The governor, the legislature, even a special commission on highways are all looking for ways to fund state roads. A select committee on Infrastructure is trying to find ways to save money and increase efficiencies by combining the Division of Highways and the governing authority of the state’s Turnpike, but simply combining the two would create serious legal implications for the state.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_415", "difficulty": "medium", "source_doc": "A Kanawha County Family Court judge is facing a battery charge following an incident at a Charleston..."}

{"question": "上下文中的'一种庆祝苏格兰诗人诞辰的晚餐活动'指的是什么？", "answer": "Burns Supper", "context": "It’s always such a nice getaway – not only do I enjoy her company and spending time with family, but there’s the accompanying “perk” that I’m not at home, facing a weekend “Gotta Get this Crap Done” list of house/car/clothing cleaning, repairs, bills, budgeting and other nasty-but-necessary aspects of growed-up life. Being here, far from the visual reminders of domestic responsibility, means that I can read, blog, read other blogs, work on my website, take on-line classes, create a photo book for our recent [隐藏] celebration and otherwise indulge myself in the “me” time I can rarely schedule when I’m at home. If we were having coffee, I’d ask what you’ve been watching on TV (should you watch TV) because I’ve been recently obsessed with Broadchurch. I’m a huge Dr. Who Fan and love David Tennant’s Doctor, but this Tennant is a dark and flawed character, driven by pain and failure – very different from his charming and powerful Time Lord. A mesmerizing plot and really detailed and wonderful character development, added to the gorgeous scenery of coastal Dorset, kept me riveted through Seasons 1 and 2. So far, they’ve succeeded with The Bletchley Circle, which I got half-way through last night. However, this time, I swear I’m going to ration myself and not serial watch it all this weekend. Does that happen to you? If we were having coffee, I’d ask you to grab your cup and come to the kitchen. Linda just made pancakes! Would you like some with blueberries or without? There’s butter and maple syrup – help yourself. If we were having coffee, I’d tell you that we had an amazing time at our Burns Supper celebration last week and I’m looking forward both to blogging about it and to making another photo book for all the guests, like I did a few years ago. We’ve got so many awesome pictures and happy memories, it’s nice to gather them all in one place. Which reminds me, while I’m not on an agenda, I guess I kinda am! I need to get working on my book, and I’m feeling fairly inspired, so I’ll thank you for stopping by, remind you to schedule us again for next week and wish you a wonderful weekend full of all the things that make you happy! I’d also like to thank Nerd in the Brain – I’ve enjoyed her “If We Were Having Coffee” posts so much, it inspired me to brew up a pot and join you all here at #WeekendCoffeeShare. This entry was posted in Blogging challenge and tagged #weekendcoffeeshare. Bookmark the permalink. Jessica Jones was awwwesome. And Tennant was wildly creepy in that one. Have you watched Daredevil? I liked that one a lot as well, even though the constant physical battery made me a little uncomfortable. Way too realistic. Welcome and thanks so much for the coffee and pancakes (please tell Linda, thanks too)! A co-worker of mine loves Broadchurch. She has loaned me a DVD but I haven’t had a chance to watch yet. Sounds like I need to find time! Enjoy your weekend. It is great to meet you and your MIL. I don’t watch TV so I can’t 换句话说 on your shows. I was not addict to it as a child. It was available. I grew up without TV, I was in college when it started. As your livehood depends on it. I can understand watching it. I’d still probably prefer a good book! Welcome! Lovely to meet you – I love that photo of you with the huge smile. That’s my Mother-in-Law, Linda. She does have a lovely smile – thank you! My husband and I feel so lucky that our families get along so well – we’ve actually all gotten to be friends (ack – getting older must do that!) and we have such a great time vacationing and spending holidays together! It is a really wonderful thing and I’ve grown to be very grateful for it. I found myself surprisingly mesmerized by Broadchurch – it really is a very different David Tennant – but it’s such a fascinating psychological thriller and they take the time to develop the characters – it’s much more like a visual novel (if that makes sense) verses somewhat typical police dramas that count on sensationalism and violence to build an audience. It does move a little slowly, but it didn’t bother me. You should check out Bletchley Circle as well – I thought it such an original premise and so far, very enjoyable. I’ll definitely have to give both of those a try! I’m at home a lot in the daytime, and I like to have the TV on while I’m working just to keep me company. I saw Broadchurch too. Was good. Just as Bletchley Circle. I saw it twice as a matter of fact, once by myself and once with Kim. I have to tell you, it was better with Kim. Everything is better with someone. I’m only getting to these right now, nearly a week late. I spent a good chunk of last Sunday watching documentaries on PBS. Most of the time, it’s Star Trek: Enterprise for me, because Trip and T’Pol (I don’t really need any other reason, really, but #itswritingresearch, too!). Today is all about Welcome to Night Vale podcasts, because I promised my 11 year old I’d be ready to listen to the next one with her on Monday, but I was over 20 episodes behind, since I was a later adopter than she was. I’m closing that gap, though! I hope your visit and break from ‘growed-up’ things – and that the book creation was lovely.

{"question": "上下文中的'一个位于南太平洋的岛屿名字'指的是什么？", "answer": "Manus", "context": "Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a patient with H.I.V. on how to adhere to a drug regimen. Doctors are very good at telling us what to do — but we are very poor at doing it. In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors’ orders. Doctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don’t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don’t get better, and that our health care costs are so high. It is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn’t doing what he is supposed to. Bad adherence doesn’t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can’t manage to stick to an exercise program. Far fewer — but far sicker and more expensive to the health care system — are the handful of emergency room frequent flyers: people with multiple serious conditions such as AIDS, diabetes, hypertension, depression, mental illness, social isolation, substance abuse or domestic violence. Such people have extraordinary problems sticking to their plans to get better, and need extraordinary help. Joe Mc[隐藏] is a 56-year-old former heroin and crack addict who lives in a single-resident-occupancy apartment in Manhattan. He spent 15 years as an addict, about 10 of them homeless. In some ways, he’s far from the typical homeless person. He used to work on Wall Street and still retains some of his Wall Street friends. In 2005, one of those friends took him to the Super Bowl. In other ways, he is absolutely typical of drug users who have hit bottom. McManus has AIDS, Hepatitis C and liver problems. “My doctors went three or four years with me not showing up,” he said in a recent interview in his apartment. “I had no relationship with her — except for her to put me in the hospital because I didn’t listen to what she had to say. I was still not addressing the fact that I was H.I.V.-positive. I was not taking my medicine and only going to the hospital when I had to be put in the hospital. I was still messing around with drugs.” McManus was hospitalized four times in the year before November, 2009. Then he got a visit from Reynaldo Rodriguez. When Rodriguez first visited McManus, he had already quit drugs, on his own. But he was still living as if he were homeless. His apartment was covered with soot and grime, the bed had cigarette burns and the refrigerator held moldy food. McManus was treating his apartment like it was the street. “How the hell are you living like this?” Rodriguez blurted out. It made a difference. McManus started taking his medicines. The medicines brought down his viral load — he was getting better, and that motivated him to take care of himself. McManus is thin and twitchy, but when I saw him was dressed in jeans and a nice zippered sweater, and the apartment was in reasonable condition. McManus is now 100 percent adherent to his medicines, and his hospital stays amounted to only a single night in the last 16 months. He said that part of it was a spiritual awakening, but it was clear that Rodriguez played a huge role. McManus now goes to all his doctor’s appointments on his own. But that doesn’t mean he follows all of his doctor’s advice. He’s no longer doing crack, but he’s still drinking — several nights a week he goes to hang out in a friend’s bar. He loves the bar — it’s his entire social network. But his Hepatitis C makes this dangerous behavior, and his doctor was stern: “You can not ever have a drink again. Not even on your birthday,” she told him. “I never have to tell you if I ever have one,” McManus thought to himself. Rodriguez and McManus worked out a compromise: he could keep going to the bar, but he had to tell his friends about his health problems so they would put the brakes on. He had to try to drink less, and keep doing tests that monitored his liver. “He’s been very honest with me,” Rodriguez said. Why more than with your doctor? I asked McManus. “She’s a doctor,” he said. The Care Coordination program, a city-wide initiative now in 28 sites in different hospitals around New York, was inspired and trained by a Boston-based program called PACT, for Prevention, Access to Care and Treatment. PACT is part of Partners in Health — a nongovernmental group famous for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and elsewhere. Part of Partners’ strategy is to use people from the community who are paid a stipend to visit patients, watch them take their pills and support them. Since 1995, PACT has been using these ideas in tough neighborhoods of Boston, first with H.I.V. patients and now with people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. The PACT project trains people from the community, some of whom have the same diseases and similar problems as their patients, to be community health workers. The new health reform law encourages pilot programs to try different forms of medical homes, and the better care and cost savings that come from improving adherence with peers or lay people like Rodriguez are attractive. The New Yorker magazine writer Atul Gawande recently profiled two clinics that use this model, in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J. There are successful programs that use nurses for outreach. The Nurse-Family Partnership sends nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, beginning in pregnancy and continuing until the child is two. The program now operates in 32 states and has proven to greatly improve the life of both child and mother. The Camden program that Gawande wrote about also uses nurses and nurse practitioners to make home visits. But nurses are expensive home visitors, and they may not even be the best people for the job. “Given the rising cost of health care, we have found having peer-based health promoters providing care management is an equally effective way to provide high-quality care at a low cost,” said Ayesha Cammaerts, the director of operations at PACT. “Especially with patients who suffer from substance abuse and mental health issues, they need someone they feel comfortable letting into their environment. Sometimes patients don’t feel they can connect to clinicians from outside their community,” she said. PACT’s methods work. A study of AIDS patients found that the patients’ use of appropriate medicines rose — they were becoming adherent. At the same time, spending on hospitalization dropped by nearly two-thirds. Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement. The PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine. Many of the deficiencies of American health care require not more technology, but the human touch. It’s certainly true for high-risk, high-cost patients, but it can help nearly everyone get better health for less money. In Saturday’s column, I’ll write about how.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_425", "difficulty": "medium", "source_doc": "Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a pat..."}

{"question": "上下文中的'全球最大的社交网络平台之一'指的是什么？", "answer": "Facebook", "context": "Mark Frigon is a senior product manager with IBM’s Enterprise Marketing Management organization, a key group involved in leading IBM’s Smarter Commerce initiative. Mark’s specialties are in Web analytics (he joined IBM as part of its acquisition of Coremetrics) and Internet privacy, an issue that has come to the forefront in recent years for digital marketers around the globe. Effective Web metrics are critical to the success of businesses looking to succeed in e-commerce and digital marketing these days, and IBM has a number of experts who spend a lot of their time in this area. One of those here in Madrid at the IBM Smarter Commerce Global Summit, Mark Frigon, is a senior product manager for Web analytics in IBM’s Enterprise Marketing Management organization. Mark sat down with me to discuss the changing nature of Web analytics, and how dramatically it has evolved as a discipline over the past few years, including the increased focus by marketers on “attribution,” the ability to directly correlate a Web marketing action and the desired result. Mark also spoke at the event about the importance for digital marketers around the globe to be more privacy-aware, a topic we also discussed in our time together, calling out in particular the “Do-Not-Track” industry self-regulatory effort that intends to put privacy controls in the hands of consumers. If you spend any time thinking about Internet privacy or Web analytics, or both, this is a conversation you won’t want to miss. Remember that team of blackjack-playing cohorts from MIT in the book (and, later, movie) “Bringing Down The House,” who fleeced a number of Vegas casinos before they were invited never to grace their gambling doors again? IBM’s Yuchun Lee explains to the IBM Smarter Commerce audience in Madrid how the company is doubling down on its investments in enterprise and social marketing management. Well, IBM executive and Unica co-founder Yuchung Lee was one of those who was asked not to come back. Permanently. Which is okay by those of us at IBM, as we’re keeping him way too busy to bother with card counting. Instead, Lee’s mathematical prowess is being applied to help companies improve their marketing capabilities, a key ingredient in the IBM Smarter Commerce soup. As Lee explained in his keynote session this afternoon here in Madrid, “this is the first time we’re bringing together Coremetrics and Unica.” He also highlighted the fact that out of the 1,700 participants here at the Summit, over 1,000 are marketeers! Lee provided a broad overview of the Enterprise Marketing Management portfolio at IBM, explaining that “we’ve shared progress as a group within IBM over the past year,” sharing that also incorporates lessons learned from both the market and IBM customers. The social buildout also incorporates enterprise analytics, tag management, and full mobile and social market capabilities that tie more closely together the marketing automation experience with the social realm. Lee also debriefed quickly on two recent acquisitions, DemandTec, which expands IBM’s EMM offerings with pricing, promotion, and product mix optimization, and Tealeaf, which rounds out IBM EMM solutions with customer experience management and analytics. As Lee explained, “A picture’s worth a thousand words,” and that’s precisely what TeaLeaf provides, the ability to look at snapshots of individual user sessions to help determine where, exactly, it is that you’re driving them crazy with your convoluted web experience! But where Lee really “hooked” the audience was in his observations about the Generation C customer, who is more connected and in control than ever! Did you know that 4 in 10 smartphone users search for an item in a store? Or that 77 percent of B2B buyers check with their peers before buying? Which, he expanded, means that it must work more closely with other disciplines and functions, including merchandising, on- and offline sales, customer service, and even with IT. But, Lee indicated, they can’t stop there. Marketing must also share customer insights with other parts of the business so that all functions can benefit from these insights. Finally, they must extend that sharing of customer insights with other key stakeholders who can benefit: Partners, agencies, customer communities, and so forth. Lee also explained that many organizations must adjust their marketing cultures to fully capitalize on the “Generation C” (“C” for “connected”) culture. They must build organizations that balance analytics and creative talents (easier said than done!), work with IT rather than around IT, and break down marketing siloes — digital and traditional marketing must consolidate and collaborate. Finally, accept mistakes and learn from them, and be agile enough to iterate and improve upon them. As even Lee can explain, there are only so many opportunities to double down in blackjack, and in business. The enterprise marketing management opportunity vis-a-vis IBM’s Smarter Commerce strategy is one of those rare opportunities. Well, that day of the year has finally arrived. That day where we all slink into our offices after four nice, long, official holidays where (mostly, we hope) people stay away from their computers and mobile phones and tablets and God knows whatever other else connected devices just long enough to make it feel like you got some real rest (even though many of you were probably dealing with unrelated, but similarly frustrating, realities —you know, like screaming kids and antagonizing in-laws). And all you could do was think about how nice it would be to come back into the nice peaceful and quiet office on Monday so you could get back to…shopping. Yes, boys and girls, cyber Monday has arrived. But judging from the results of the IBM Coremetrics Benchmark Black Friday e-retailing analysis, you really need not worry about coming into the office anymore just so you can get yourself an extra slurp of broadband. This is 2011, yo, all you gotta do is break out that iPad and you’ll be standing in front of Macys women’s wear or Best Buy’s electronics section in seconds! But while you’re out there figuring out your Cyber Monday strategy, I’m going to hit the highlights reel for the weekend in e-shopping. U.S shoppers apparently took great advantage of early sales this holiday, driving a 39.3 percent year-over-year increase in online Thanksgiving day spending while setting the stage for 24.3 percent online growth on Black Friday compared to the same period last year. Consumer spending increases. The aggressive shopping we witnessed on Thanksgiving Day this year carried over into Black Friday, with online sales increasing 24.3 percent annually. Mobile Bargain Hunting. Black Friday also saw the arrival of the mobile deal seeker who embraced their devices as a research tool for both in-store and online bargains. Mobile traffic increased to 14.3 percent (compared to 5.6 percent last year). Mobile Sales On the Getgo. Sales on mobile devices surged to 9.8 percent (a tripling from last year’s 3.2 percent). Apple’s One Stop Shop. Mobile shopping was led by Apple, with the iPhone and iPad ranking one and two for consumers shopping on mobile devices (5.4 percent 4.8 percent respectively). Together, the iPhone and iPad accounted for 10.2 percent of all online retail. Apparently, it ain’t easy bein’ an Android on Black Friday. The iPad Factor. Shoppers using the iPad led to more retail purchases more often per visit than other mobile devices, leading one to wonder about the real estate to deal closing ratio. The bigger the device, the larger the average order value? Possibly, but this number can’t lie: Conversion rates for the iPad were 4.6 percent, compared to 2.8 for all other mobile devices. The iPad was this weekend’s e-shopping mobile king. Social Influence. Shoppers referred from Social Networks generated 0.53 percent of all online sales on Black Friday, with [隐藏] leading the pack and accounting for a full 75 percent of all social network traffic. Social Media Chit Chat. Boosted by a 110 percent increase in discussion volume compared to 2010, top discussion topics on social media sites immediately before Friday showed a focus on the part of consumers to share tips on how to avoid the rush. Topics included out-of-stock concerns, waiting times and parking, and a spike in positive sentiment around Cyber Monday sales. Surgical Shopping Goes Mobile: Mobile shoppers demonstrated a laser focus that surpassed that of other online shoppers with a 41.3 percent bounce rate on mobile devices versus online shopping rates of 33.1 percent. This data came from findings of the IBM Coremetrics fourth annual Black Friday Benchmark, which tracks more than a million transactions a day, analyzing terabytes of raw data from 500 retailers nationwide. With this data, IBM helps retailers better understand and respond to their customers — across the organization — improving sourcing, inventory management, marketing, sales, and services programs. You can get more background on the study here. Black Friday: U.S. Online Retail Up 20% Year-Over-Year! I had absolutely nothing to do with shopping today, online or off. But I seemed to have been a minority, and for those retailers looking to the holiday season to help bolster an otherwise anemic year, they will be excited by the news delivered today by the IBM Coremetrics e-retailing Black Friday Benchmark Report. No flies on those guys! Apparently they were too busy counting everyone else’s clicks to pursue any of their own. Click image to enlarge. Black Friday e-retail sales in U.S. were up 20% over the same period last year, with consumers turning to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for their e-shopping efforts more than they ever have. E-retail sales at major online retailers were up 20 percent as of 3 P.M. EST this afternoon, compared to the same time on the Friday after Thanksgiving last year. The survey monitors some 500 major U.S. Online retailers, and the 20 percent is in line with the 20 percent year-over-year increase IBM was reporting mid-day yesterday. However, apparently lots of folks are holding out until they’ve allowed the turkey trytophan to kick in and the evening football games to start, because full-day online Thanksgiving sales ended 39 percent up over the holiday last year and they soared Thursday evening. Mobile devices also played a much bigger role in online shopping this year, according to the benchmark. Shoppers are making 9.73 percent of their purchases from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, about the same as Thanksgiving day. And, as much as 17.37 percent of traffic to e-retail sites is coming from mobile devices, higher than even the 15.2 recorded yesterday. Consumer spending increased: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9 percent, with consumers pushing the average order value up from $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent. Luxury goods are making a comeback. Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6 percent increase in sales. Social shopping. Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their favorite brands’ social presence, and are turning to their social networking friends for information about deals and inventory levels. Though the percentage of visitors arriving from social sites is fairly small relative to all online visitors — nearly 1 percent — it’s gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space. Department stores. They’ve become the research engine of choice for consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over year on department store sites. Health and Beauty. A reported rise of 73.1 percent in the number of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a 53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed an order. In-Store Sales for Consumer Electronics and Appliances. These are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to an analytics-based forecast from IBM’s Global Business Services division. U.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, which has led to strong pent-up demand for consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in today’s economy. Stay tuned here on the Turbo blog for other upcoming reports on the holiday season’s retail tidings. It’s still Black Friday, we still have the weekend, and Cyber Monday is a full three days away! The weekend in sports proved to be as about as exciting as I had hoped. Northern Ireland’s Darren Clarke became the third man from that region to win a golf major in 3 of the last 6, and it was Clarke’s first British Open title. And as to the U.S. Women’s soccer team, they played a nailbiter of a match, but in the end the team from Japan won on penalty kicks. My hat goes off to both teams. I had a whole living room full of soccer fans, and we were all nervous wrecks up to that last penalty kick that gave Japan this year’s World Cup trophy. Still, it was an awesome game all the way around, and I wish my friends in Japan a very happy celebration. They could probably stand some good news about now! Later today, IBM will announces its second quarter 2010 earnings. You can check the Investor Relations site for more details. On the announcement front, today saw the introduction of a new cloud-based Web analytics and digital marketing suite intended to help organizations automate online marketing campaigns across their online channels, including web sites, social media networks, and even mobile phones. The new offering combines the best of Coremetrics and Unica, and provides analytics that help companies better determine the effectiveness of new products and services, fine tune their marketing campaigns, and create personalized offers in real-time across channels. With 64 percent of consumers making a first purchase because of a digital experience, it’s critical that marketers understand online behavior and refine their marketing activities accordingly. Supports deep analysis into how customers interact with a brand over time and when each marketing program is the most effective. Using this technology, businesses will be able to evaluate Facebook or Twitter activity, and offer customers tailored promotions delivered to their mobile devices on the fly. IBM’s suite also enables businesses to deliver and fine tune digital marketing programs based on what customers are doing offline. For example, a consumer who purchased a new tablet in a brick-and-mortar store would receive special offers via email to purchase tablet accessories. The benefit to the customer is a consistent, relevant brand experience that reflects all of their online preferences, not just what they did, read or saw on one specific site. The IBM Coremetrics Web Analytics and Digital Marketing Optimization Suite is the newest addition to IBM’s family of Smarter Commerce solutions,which is focused on helping companies more effectively market, sell and secure greater customer loyalty in the era of social networking and mobile computing. Smarter Commerce transforms how companies manage and swiftly adapt to customer and industry trends across marketing, selling and service processes that span the entire commerce cycle, putting the customer at the center of their decisions and actions.

{"question": "上下文中的'与之有关联的'指的是什么？", "answer": "相关", "context": "it is well known that quantum key distribution is one of the most interesting subjects in quantum information science , which was pioneered by c.bennett and g.brassard in 1984[1 ] . in the original paper of bennett , single photon communication was employed as implementation of quantum key distribution . however , despite that it is not essential in great idea of bennett , many researchers employed single photon communication scheme to realize bb84 , b92[2 ] . because of the difficulties of single photon communication in practical sense , it was discussed whether one can realize a secure key distribution guaranteed by quantum nature based on light wave communication or not . in 1998 , h.p.yuen and a.kim[3 ] proposed another scheme for key distribution based on communication theory(signal detection theory ) . this scheme corresponds to an implementation of secret key sharing which was information theoretically predicted by maurer[4 ] , et al . however , yuen s idea was found independently from maurer s discussion . in the first paper of yuen - kim[3 ] , they showed that if noises of eve(eavesdropper ) and bob(receiver ) are statistically independent , secure key distribution can be realized even if they are classical noises , in which they employed a modification of b92 protocol[2 ] . following yk s first paper , a simple experimental demonstration of yk protocol based on classical noise was reported[5 ] , and recently yk scheme with 1 gbps and 10 km long fiber system based on quantum shot noise was demonstrated[6 ] . however , these schemes are not unconditional secure . that is , ability of signal detection of eve can be superior to that of bob . as a result , an interesting question arises `` is it possible to create a system with current technology that could provide a communication in which always bob s error probability is superior to that of eve ? '' in proceedings paper of qcm and c 2002 , yuen and his coworker reported that yk protocol can be unconditional secure , even if one uses conventional optical communication system[7 ] . this is interesting result for engineer , and will open a new trend of quantum cryptography . in this report , we simulate practical feature of yuen - kim protocol for quantum key distribution with unconditional secure , and propose a scheme to implement them using our former experimental setup[6 ] . a fundamental concept of yuen - kim protocol follows the next remark . + * remark * : _ if there are statistically independent noises between eve and bob , there exist a secure key distribution based on communication . _ + they emphasized that the essential point of security of the key distribution is detectability of signals . this is quite different with the principle of bb-84 , et al which are followed by no cloning theorem . that is , bb-84 and others employ a principle of disturbance of quantum states to give a guarantee of security , but yk protocol employs a principle of communication theory . it was clarified that this scheme can be realized as a modification of b-92 . however , this scheme allows us use of classical noise , and it can not provide unconditional secure . then , yuen and his coworker showed that yk scheme is to be unconditional secure in which a fundamental theorem in quantum detection theory was used for his proof of security as follows . + * theorem * : ( helstrom - holevo - yuen ) + _ signals with non commuting density operators can not be distinguished without error . _ + so if we assign non commuting density operators for bit signals 1 and 0 , then one can not distinguish without error . when the error is 1/2 based on quantum noise , there is no way to distinguish them . so we would like to make such a situation on process between alice and eve . to do so , a new version of yk scheme was given as follows : _ _ * the sender(alice ) uses an explicit key(a short key:@xmath0 , expanded into a long key:@xmath1 by use of a stream cipher ) to modulate the parameters of a multimode coherent state . * state @xmath2 is prepared . bit encoding can be represented as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 . * alice uses the running key @xmath1 to specify a basis from a set [隐藏] m uniformly distributed two - mode coherent state . * the message is encoded as @xmath6 . this mapping of the stream of bits is the key to be shared by alice and bob . because of his knowledge @xmath1 , bob can demodulate from @xmath6 to @xmath5 . here , let us introduce the original discussion on the security . the ciphering angle @xmath7 could have @xmath8 in general as discrete or continuous variable determined by distribution of keys . a ciphered two mode state may be @xmath9 the corresponding density operator for all possible choices of @xmath8 is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 or @xmath12 . the problem is to find the minimum error probability that eve can achieve in bit determination . to find the optimum detection process for discrimination between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the problem of quantum detection theory . the solution is given by[8 ] @xmath15 as an example of encoding to create @xmath16 which is the error probability of eve , yuen et al suggested certain modulation scheme . in that case , closest values of a given @xmath8 can be associated with distinct bits from the bit at position @xmath8 , and two closest neighboring states represent distinct bits which means a set of base state . in this scheme , they assumed that one chooses a set of basis state(keying state for 1 and 0 ) for bits without overlap . the error probability for density operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 becomes 1/2 , when number of a set of basis state increases . asymptotic property of the error probability depends on the amplitude of coherent state[7][9 ] . original scheme of yk protocol in the above can be realized by practical devices . to apply them to fiber communication system , we would like to realize them by intensity modulation / direct detection scheme . if one does not want to get perfect yk scheme , one can more simplify the implementation of yk protocol . from a fundamental principle in quantum detection theory , we can construct non - commuting density operators from sets based on non - orthogonal states when one does not allow overlap of the selection of a set of basis state for 1 and 0 . on the other hand , when we allow overlap for selection of a set of basis state , one can use orthogonal state to construct the same density operators for 1 and 0 . that is , @xmath17 . however , in this case , unknown factor for eve is only an initial short key , and a stream of bits that eve observed is perfectly the same as those of alice and bob , though eve can not estimate the bits at that time . this gives still insecure situation . so , here , we employ a combination of non - orthogonality and overlap selection in order to reduce the number of basis sets . let us assume that the maximum amplitude is fixed as @xmath18 . we divide it into 2 m . so we have m sets of basis state@xmath19 . total set of basis state is given as shown in fig.1 . each set of basis state is used for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , depending on initial keys . @xmath22 so the density operators for 1 and 0 for eve are @xmath23 for the sets of @xmath24 , @xmath25,@xmath26 , let us assign 0 and 1 by the same way as eqs(4),(5 ) . in this case , eve can not get key information , but she can try to know the information of quantum states used for bit transmission . so this is the problem for discrimination of 2 m pure states . the error probability is given by @xmath27 although we have many results for calculation of optimum detection problems[10][11][12 ] , to solve this problem is still difficult at present time , because the set of states does not have complete symmetric structure . so we here give the lower bound and tight upper bound . the lower bound is given by the minimum error probability:@xmath28 for signal set @xmath29 which are neighboring states . it is given as follows : @xmath30 } \\right)\\ ] ] the upper bound is given by applying square root measurement for 2 m pure states . the numerical properties are shown in fig.2-(a ) . thus if m increases , then her error for information on quantum states increases . in this case , pure guessing corresponds to @xmath31 . the error probability of bob , however , is independent of the number of set of basis state , and it is given as follows : @xmath32 we emphasize that eve can not get key information in this stage , because the information for 1 and 0 are modulated by the way of eqs(4),(5 ) . furthermore , this scheme can send 2 m bits by m sets of basis state . let us apply the original scheme such that m bits are sent by m sets of basis state . in this case , eve will try to get key information , so the density operators for eve become mixed states @xmath13 , @xmath14 consisting of set of states which send 1 and 0 , respectively . the numerical properties are shown in fig.2-(b ) . both schemes have almost same security , but the latter

use here our proposed system . figure 3 shows the experimental setup . the laser diode serves as 1.3@xmath33 m light source . a pattern generator provides a signal pulse string to send keys . a modulator which selects basis state follows a driver of laser diode . the selector gives selection of amplitude and assignment of 1 and 0 , and is controlled by initial keys . the laser driver is driven by output signals of modulator . the optical divider corresponds to eve . the case 1 is a type of opaque \" , and the case 2 is a type of translucent \" . the channel consists of 10 km fiber and att . we can change the distance equivalently from 10 km to 200 km by att . the speed of pulse generator to drive laser diode is 311mbps , 622mbps , and 1.2gbps . the detector of bob is ingaas pin photo loaded by 50@xmath34 register , and it is connected to an error probability counter which can apply to 12 gbps . the dark current is 7@xmath35 and the minimum received power of our system is about -30 dbm . in this system , the problem for degree of security is only power advantage of eve which will be set in near transmitter(alice ) . when the eavesdropping is opaque , the error probability of bob increases drastically , and the error probability counter shows almost 1/2 , which means that the error of eve is also 1/2 . in this case , problem of communication distance is not so important . we can detect the existence of eve in any distance of channel . when the eavesdropping is translucent , eve has to take only few power(@xmath36 from the main stream of bits sequence in order to avoid the power level disturbance . in this case , the error of bob does not increase . as a result , alice and bob can not detect the existence of eve . the secure communication distance depends on the error probabilities of bob and eve . let @xmath37 be transparency of channel from alice to bob . the detectability for bob in this experiment setup depends on the signal distance(amplitude difference between two states as basis state ) : @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and that of eve depends on the signal distance : @xmath40 . here we assume that @xmath41 , and the total loss is 20db which corresponds to 100 km . since our receiver requires about -30 dbm , the transmitter is -10 dbm . when m increases , sufficiently the error of eve increases . we examined a simulation of yk protocol based on intensity modulation / direct detection fiber communication system , and showed a design of implementation of secure system based on our experimental setup which was used to demonstrate the first version of implementation of yk protocol . we will soon report complete demonstration in experiment by the above system .", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_449",

{"question": "上下文中的'英语中常用的定冠词'指的是什么？", "answer": "The", "context": "OK, so this statement is completely wrong, but it serves to illustrate the false conclusion of thinking that we are descended from chimpanzees because we evolved from an ape of some sort and they are our closest living relative. But we evolved from them no more than they from us. What we do share is a common ancestor which we both descended from, and this makes chimpanzees our closest living cousins in species terms, but not our actual ancestors. Understanding common ancestors is vital to understanding evolution and classification, so lets go back in time to trace our little corner of the tree of life. DNA analysis has shown that the ancestor linking us with chimps existed about six million years ago, and other evidence suggests it was certain to have lived in Africa. No fossil has been found that can be definitely attributed to it, but there are 你可能还喜欢 a few contenders. So, since we have no proper name let’s just call it ape A. But what did it look like? It would have been fairly close in appearance to a chimpanzee and it would have walked on four legs (using knuckle walking similar to chimps and gorillas), lived in the forest and been an excellent tree climber. Around this time the climate began to cool a little and become dryer, meaning the forest in Africa began to thin out and in places open plain took over. This may have caused the population of ape A to become split into two, and therefore each group pursued it’s own independent evolutionary path. One group remained in the forest and so there were few external pressures for it to change – it would eventually evolve into chimpanzees. [隐藏] other group must have come under some environmental pressure to cause it to change. This may have been a further thinning of the forest it was living in, but for whatever reason, it gradually evolved to become more adapted to living in the plains rather than the forest. This branch eventually became modern humans. So ape A is the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees and makes them our closest living cousin within the animal world. It also means that the chimpanzee’s closest cousin is us, rather than any other ape. We have both had the same amount of time to evolve since ape A existed, but the reason we look so dissimilar is due to the different path that the environment led us to take – we took to the plains and became hunter gatherers instead of staying in the forests. The next nearest living relative to us (and chimpanzees) is the gorilla and we need to go back 7 million years from present to find the ancestor we all share – call it ape B. Again it would have lived in the African forest and there would have been a split in the population somehow, one line leading to gorillas and the other to ape A, and subsequently to chimpanzees and us. Going back even further, about 18 million years from present, we come across the common ancestor to all the great apes. Great apes comprise gibbons, orang utans, gorillas, chimpanzees and humans. They are a separate group from monkeys and the key difference is that apes have no tail whereas all monkeys do (though in a few it is almost reduced to nothing). This is a good illustration of how common ancestors are so useful in defining evolutionary paths and modern classification. If apes are defined as separate from monkeys due to their lack of tail (although it’s actually slightly more complicated than that), then this could be traced back to the one single species that lacked a tail and is ancestor to all subsequent apes. All major groupings will have a single common ancestor at some point. So for example the first mammal species I talked about in a previous post would have had mammary glands, three bones in the ear, warm blood and fur – and this is why all mammals possess these and why we put them into a group separate from all other animals. As we go back in time there will be common ancestors to larger and larger groupings, until we reach that one first originator of all life with that one huge characteristic that all life shares – DNA.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_455", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "OK, so this statement is completely wrong, but it serves to illustrate the false conclusion of think..."}

The nurses must be careful and precise as giving too little anesthesia can be just as detrimental as giving too much. Nurse anesthetists work in a variety of health care settings, including dental, podiatric, and obstetrician offices, as well as hospitals. Nurses specializing in anesthesia must be registered nurses (RNs) because of the complexity and sensitivity of the duties. Though one can become an RN by completing either a diploma program from a nursing school, an associate degree in nursing, or a bachelor’s degree in nursing and successfully passing the NCLEX-RN examination, those wishing to go into anesthetics must obtain a graduate nursing degree. Nurse anesthetists must earn at least a master’s degree in health care, have experience working as an RN, and enroll in a nurse anesthetist program. After completing the anesthetist program, nurses must pass an examination given by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, which will gain them certification and licensure to practice. As the health care field grows, the demand for medical services will grow as well. While many medical services are routine and non-invasive, more than 26 million people in the country undergo medical procedures that require anesthesia, according to the Mayo Clinic. With these numbers, the need for nurse anesthetists is clear. As the population climbs, the increase in the number of patients flowing into physician offices every day will also boost the need for more nurse anesthetists.

While it is a matter of pride to own your own home, there are many factors to consider before you take the plunge. The financial viability of the decision and the choice of location are crucial factors. CAs who have just started their career need to also consider their future business plans and how investing in a home will affect the liquidity position of their business. The down payment can create a dent in your finances. You need to consider what % of the cost of the house needs to be paid as down payment. An analysis of how much of reserves you will have in your account after the down payment, has to be made. [隐藏] required, negotiate with the builder to bring down the down payment amount. A special home loan for chartered accountants can come take the pressure off your savings which would be utilised to a significant extent when paying the down payment of your new property. You need to have clarity about the long term plans for your practise. If you wish to expand your business in the years to come, it would mean huge investments by way of infrastructure, office rent, utilities, employees’ salaries and so on. If you have plans of growing your business, it may not be a wise idea to commit your finances for the long term by investing in a house. While buying a home, it is extremely important to be aware of the source of finance. The right financing option should reduce the cost of lending and maximize benefits. Today various innovative and customised financial products like home loans for chartered accountants are available in the market. They come with various features which make them the ideal financial tool for CAs looking forward to buying their new home and make them score over a regular home loan. Make a comparison of the rent you may have to pay for a rented home with the monthly EMIs that an own house would call for. If the rentals in your are affordable, it would be advisable to stay in a rented house and invest into your business. Purchasing a house would block your capital in a venture that is not income-generating. A home loan for CAs offers high loan amounts up to Rs.2 crore which can be repaid in easy EMIs at a nominal interest. Bajaj Finserv offers customised Home Loans for Chartered Accountants up to Rs.2 crore that is approved within a day from your application. With minimal documentation requirements and criteria that can be easily met by CAs is what makes these loans score over regular home loans. What’s more is that they come with value-added benefits like doorstep document pickup facility, property search assistance services and property dossier. You could also avail the loan in a Flexi Loan format and reduce your EMIs by up to 45% as you pay interest only on the sum used by you and withdraw and prepay the loan as many times you want at no extra cost. The locality where you wish to invest your money needs to be chosen with care. The accessibility to railway stations, airports, supermarkets, schools and hospitals needs to be checked. The upcoming developmental activities need to be looked into. Investing in a locality which is growing at a fast pace would ensure you good returns on your investment. If you are planning to buy a house in a premium locality, there is every chance that the maintenance charges are likely to be exorbitant.

{"question": "上下文中的'与主题有关联的'指的是什么？", "answer": "相关", "context": "the enhancement of heat transfer by embedded nano - particles in a fluid subjected to a temperature gradient is an important issue that is expected to help in technological application like solar heating , and various cooling devices , including miniaturized computer processors . accordingly , many experiments were conducted in the last couple of decades @xcite , with a breakthrough announcement from a group at argonne national laboratory , who studied water and oil - based nanofluids containing copper oxide nanopaticles , and found an amazing 60% enhancement in thermal conductivity for only a 5% volume fraction of nanoparticles @xcite . subsequent research has however generated what ref . @xcite referred to as `` an astonishing spectrum of results '' . results in the literature show sometime enhancement in the thermal conductivity compared to the prediction of the maxwell - garnett effective medium theory , and sometime values that are less than the same prediction @xcite . confusingly enough , these discrepancies occur even for the same fluid and the same size and composition of the nano - particles . some of these conflicting results were explained by either the formation of percolated clusters of particles ( for the case of enhancement with respect to the maxwell - garret prediction ) or by surface ( kapitza ) resistance ( for the case of reduction with respect to the same prediction ) @xcite . interestingly enough , enhancement is typically seen in _ quiescent _ fluids , and one expects that the agglomeration of clusters will become impossible in flows , be them laminar or turbulent . of course , in technological application flowing nano - fluids may be the rule rather than the exception . thus our aim in this article is to develop models of heat flux in flowing nano - fluids , where the flow can be either laminar or turbulent . in such systems we can not expect an enhancement of heat flux due to the agglomeration of particles ( at least at low volume fractions ) , and for the sake of simplicity we will assume that there is no kapitza resistance . since it was reported in the literature that elongated nano - particles are superior to spheres in quiescent nanofluids @xcite , we will study both spheres and spheroids in flowing nanofluids . we will argue that generically elongation may not be advantageous at all , and will explain why . for completeness , we will begin by studying quiescent nanofluids under a temperature gradient . we will present extensive numerical simulation that will demonstrate a very good agreement with the maxwell - garnett theory for spherical nano - particles and with the generalization of nan et al @xcite for elongated particles . in the case of flowing nanofluid we will offer a model that will provide expressions for the heat transfer for different values of the aspect ratio of the particles , for different volume fractions and for laminar and turbulent flows . the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ( [ s : model ] ) we formulate the problem , describe the equations of motion and the numerical procedure , and discuss the dilute suspension approximation . in section [ s:3body ] we describe the results of numerical simulations of spherical and spheroidal particles in a fluid at rest and in a shear flow . in section [ s:4model ] we develop an analytical model of heat transfer characteristic , i.e. the nusselt number , and analyze the model predictions of heat flux enhancement in two limiting cases of very strong brownian diffusion and a weak one . in this section we formulate the model for dilute nanofluids laden with elongated spheroidal nanoparticles . this includes the basic equation of motion for the velocity and temperature fields and the boundary conditions ( with constant velocity and temperature gradients far away from particles ) . we also present details of the numerical simulations and their validation . when the nanofluid is very dilute one can disregard the effect of one particle on the other and consider the nanofluid as an ensemble of noninteracting particles . one of these is shown in fig . [ geometry ] . the center of the spheroidal particle is at the position @xmath0 in the middle of a plane couette flow between two @xmath1-separated horizontal parallel walls that move in the @xmath2-direction with opposite velocities @xmath3 . due to the symmetry , the forces are balanced , and the particle neither migrates nor collides with the walls ; the particle s center remains at @xmath4 . this allows us to eliminate in the numerics any effect of the particle sweeping parallel to the walls . note that this effect is anyway absent in homogeneous cases . we employ periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 direction . this results in a periodic replication of the computational box ( together with the particle ) in the @xmath7-plane , leading to a `` monolayer '' of an infinite number of periodically distributed particles in the @xmath7-plane . remarkably enough ( and by reasons that will be explained below ) , this allows us to reproduce in numerics with a _ single particle _ effects of _ a finite volume fraction _ @xmath8 at least up to @xmath9 . the walls are kept at fixed temperatures @xmath10 . in the absence of particles these boundary conditions give rise to a vertical temperature gradient @xmath11 and shear @xmath12 ( see fig . [ geometry ] ) . the spheroidal particle s semi - axes are @xmath13 ( the longest ) and @xmath14 ( the shortest ) , @xmath15 ( fig . [ geometry ] ) . the thermal diffusivity inside the particle is @xmath16 . the carrier fluid has a kinematic viscosity @xmath17 and a thermal diffusivity @xmath18 . for simplicity , at this stage we neglect the effect of gravity and the particle mass . the co - ordinate system and polar angles are given by : [ eq : anglesdefs ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the projection of the unit - vector @xmath21 onto the axis @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the angle between the particle s largest axis and the @xmath25-axis . the particle in a plane couette flow . the largest particle axis is shown as a ( red ) rod . the velocity field ( far from the particle ) is @xmath26 where the shear @xmath27 in the particle - free flow with @xmath1 being the distance between the walls . for the theoretical development we assume the creeping flow conditions as in @xcite.,width=321 ] in the absence of particles , changing the intensity of the laminar shear flow does not change the heat flux since there is no velocity orthogonal to the wall and the system is homogeneous in the direction parallel to the wall . in the presence of a particle , the shear induces it to rotate , the simplest case being a spherical particle which rotates at a constant angular velocity @xmath28 ( provided the particle radius is much smaller than the distance to the wall ) . this rotation induces a vertical flow motion near the particle . the modification of the velocity profile has three consequences . the first directly affects the heat convection in the fluid through a convective contribution @xmath29 . the second comes from the particle rotation which brings up the hotter side of the particle during its rotation . the third changes the heat conduction due to a modification of the temperature profiles at the surface of the particle . in the case of non spherical particles the presence of a shear has also a strong influence of the statistical distribution of particle orientations . to fix the notation we list here the most important dimensionless parameters involved in the problem : [ dimnumdefs ] @xmath30 note that the particle s largest axis defines our length - scale also , @xmath31 the dynamical effects previously mentioned can be quantitatively studied by solving the following system of equations for the temperature in the fluid , @xmath32 , and in the particle , @xmath33 , [ basiceqs ] @xmath34 together with the boundary conditions , @xmath35 the fluid velocity in the whole domain can be found by solving the incompressible navier - stokes equations : @xmath36 together with non - slip boundary conditions at the surface of the particle and at the walls : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the carrier fluid density and @xmath39 is the pressure . clearly , on nano - scales the temperature difference ( across a particle ) is sufficiently small to allow us to neglect the dependence of the fluid s and particle s material parameters on the temperature , i.e. we take @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 as constants . the dynamics of a neutrally buoyant particle is governed by the equations of the solid body rotation @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angular velocity in the body - fixed frame , @xmath42 is the torque in the body - fixed frame and @xmath43 is the moment of inertia tensor . the numerical simulation of the conjugated heat transfer problem given by eqs is performed by means of two coupled d3q19 lattice boltzmann ( lb ) equations under the so - called bgk approximation @xcite . details of the simulations are presented in appendix [ ss : numerics ] . besides purely numerical means , the control of the simulations was done by its comparison with known analytical solutions . as an example , fig [ f:2 ] shows the comparison between the analytical temperature profile ( [ eq : lnl ] ) ( solid red line ) and numerical profile ( black dots ) for a moderately big spherical particle [ @xmath44 . temperature profile along a line passing through the center of a spherical particle ( of radius @xmath45 ) in a quiescent fluid . dashed ( green ) line conductive temperature profile in the pure fluid , solid ( red ) curve eq . ( [ eq : lnl ] ) @xcite for an infinite domain with a temperature gradient , dots numerical results ( at lattice points ) with @xmath46 ( full circles ) and @xmath47 ( squares ) . the present test was performed with pr @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 lattice units.,width=321 ] the second test was the comparison in fig . [ jeffery_test ] of the particle s angular velocity theoretically obtained by jeffery @xcite and simulated by our lb - realization . for more details , again see appendix [ ss : numerics ] . here we discuss how to relate the contribution of a single particle to the heat flux with the total contribution of many weakly - interacting particles randomly distributed in the flow occupying a finite volume fraction @xmath8 . the first step is to consider _ fully dilute limit _ , @xmath51 , in which we can exploit the fact that the particle contribution is additive and proportional to @xmath8 . in this way we can introduce the nusselt number as the ratio between the total heat flux ( inside the computational cell ) and the conductive heat flux in the basic cell : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total heat flux , @xmath54 is the conductive part and @xmath55 is the effective heat diffusivity of the composite fluid . also , @xmath56 . without particles @xmath57 and nu @xmath48 . for _ dilute suspensions _ , in which @xmath58 , nu can be expanded in powers of @xmath8 @xcite : [ 53 ] @xmath59 where @xmath60 are dimensionless constants dependent on the peclet number , on the particle s aspect ratio , @xmath61 , on the relative heat diffusivity , @xmath62 , and maybe other parameters like reynolds or prandtl numbers [ see eqs . ( [ dimnumdefs ] ) ] , i.e. @xmath63 . as expected , in our simulations the quantity @xmath64nu@xmath65 is indeed proportional to @xmath8 for @xmath66 . this allows us to find @xmath67 as a function of other parameters of the problem . the next order term in the expansion , i.e. @xmath68 , contains very important information about how nu depends on @xmath8 for small but finite values of @xmath8 . generally speaking , to get this information from numerics one needs to solve eqs . for many particles , randomly distributed in space . we demonstrate that this problem can be _ tremendously simplified _ by reducing it to a _ one - particle _ case , in which this particle of volume @xmath69 is put in the center of computational box of volume @xmath70 with _ periodic boundary conditions _ in the horizontal ( orthogonal to the temperature gradient ) @xmath5- and @xmath6-directions . in this way the total system can be considered as constructed from a periodic repetition of the basic elementary cell in the @xmath5- and @xmath6-directions . comparing in subsec . [ sss : sphere - rest ] our numerical results with analytical findings obtained under the assumption of random particle distributions , we see that the precise particle distribution is not essential what really matters is the actual volume fraction . the reason for that is quite simple : as one sees in fig . [ f:2 ] , the deviation from the linear temperature profile becomes important at distances@xmath71 ) that the distance should be smaller than @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the deviation criterion , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 . ] smaller than the particle diameter @xmath76 for both @xmath77 and @xmath47 . thus any nonlinear dependence of nu on @xmath8 can appear only if the particles are sufficiently close to overlap the deviation from linear temperature profile . we see from our numerics that the this interaction causes 10% deviation from the straight line in nu vs. @xmath8 dependence for volume fractions of about 0.1 and more for @xmath78 . for @xmath79 there is some nonlinear dependence of nu on @xmath8 but it practically coincides for the random and the periodic distributions of particles . in this section we begin with collecting the required information about the dependence of @xmath80 on the various parameters ( [ dimnumdefs ] ) . to do this we consider simple limiting cases , for which some of these parameters are put to zero . we start with the case of spherical particles . ( color online ) . quiescent fluid , spherical particle in the center . dashed curves theory , eq . ( [ a - nlf ] ) and dots simulations for different @xmath62 ( color - coded from `` cold''-blue , @xmath82 , to `` hot''-red , @xmath47 ) . insert : @xmath83 . dashed curve theory , eq . ( [ a - nlf ] ) and dots simulations for different @xmath62 ( same color - code ) . notice , that for @xmath84 runs the accuracy is better then @xmath85% , while for @xmath86 runs it is about @xmath87% , and only for really small @xmath88 runs it reaches the worst value of @xmath89% . these means that for our purposes , usually the runs with @xmath86 box is fully satisfactory.,width=328 ] + here we consider the simplest case of a spherical particle ( @xmath90 ) in a fluid at rest ( re = pe = 0 ) . chiew and glandt @xcite suggested the following formula for this case : [ a - nlf ] @xmath91 we notice that the expression for @xmath83 which controls the very dilute limit ( @xmath51 ) is the same as in the maxwell model @xcite . obviously , for @xmath82 one has zero effect , i.e. nu @xmath48 . for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and one has maximal possible enhancement ( at fixed @xmath58 ) . for @xmath94 one has 25% of this value , @xmath95 gives already 50% of the effect , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . clearly , the larger @xmath62 the better , but increasing @xmath62 above 100 is not effective . actually , eq . ( [ a - nlf ] ) includes also information about the nonlinear dependence @xmath99 . however this dependence is very weak in the relevant range of parameters : e.g. for @xmath100 and @xmath101 the difference between @xmath99 and its linear approximation is only 15% . for smaller @xmath62 this difference is even smaller . the physical reason for that was explained at the end of previous section . we tested the prediction of eq . ( [ a - nlf ] ) by simulating the heat flux in a periodic box as explained above in sec . [ s : model ] and in appendix [ ss : numerics ] . for the fluid at rest the ( volume averaged ) nusselt number ( as a function of @xmath8 at different values of @xmath62 ) was measured and is shown in fig . [ fig : nu64 ] , where the inset shows @xmath83 . the overall conclusion is that 0.1 cm _ eq . ( [ a - nlf ] ) agrees extremely well with all our simulations and thus can be used in modeling the effect of spherical particles in a fluid at rest . _ the next important question is how the particle rotation affects the heat flux . as already mentioned , this rotation induces fluid motions around the particles thus causing convective contribution to the heat flux . this changes the temperature profile around the particles and , in turn , affects the heat flux inside the particles . to study these issues analytically is extremely difficult and thus numerical simulations can play a crucial role . due to the fact that we have to deal with a number of parameters , we will carefully examine them starting with the simplest case of spherical particles . results for spheroidal particles are discussed in sec . [ sss : el - rot ] . we begin by considering the case @xmath82 ; such a particle at rest does not affect the heat flux , thus nu @xmath48 . in fig . [ f:4 ] , upper left panel , we present nu(pe)/nu@xmath102 as a function of pe for @xmath82 at various volume fractions ( from 9.3% to 19.4% ) , while the inset is showing nu _ vs_. pe . observing the data , we suggest for pe@xmath103 the following ansatz [ pe^2 ] @xmath104 \\,,\\ ] ] shown in this panel as a straight dashed ( red ) line . one sees that eq . ( [ nu - pe ] ) is approximately valid up to pe @xmath105 , where the deviation is about 1% . we note also that for @xmath82 the value of @xmath106 is very small , @xmath107 . a similar analysis for @xmath77 , ( cf . [ f:4 ] , upper right panel ) , shows that eq . ( [ nu - pe ] ) fits the data even better with a similar value @xmath108 . we see that @xmath106 depends weakly on @xmath8 but more strongly on @xmath62 . thus , to determine the leading @xmath62-dependence we put a sphere of radius 18 in a @xmath86 computational volume ( all in lattice units ) ; this is equivalent to @xmath109 , see fig . [ f:4 ] , lower panels . the @xmath62-dependence of @xmath110 in eq . ( [ nu - pe ] ) in the range of @xmath111 can be fitted by : [ eq : bvsk ] @xmath112 , \\\\ b_1 & \\simeq & 9 \\!\\times\\ ! 10^{-5 } , \\ b_2 \\simeq 0.15\\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for larger pe@xmath113 , the nu _ vs. _ pe dependence deviates down , as expected , because at pe @xmath114 this dependence should saturate . our analysis shows that this dependence can be fitted with a good accuracy by the formula that generalizes eq . : ^ 2}\\ .\\ ] ] the upper left panel in fig . [ f:4 ] shows by a solid ( black ) curve how this model works for @xmath82 ( with pe@xmath116 and pe@xmath117 ) . having in mind that in many applications related to nanofluids the value of pe is smaller than 0.01 and in any case rarely exceeds unity , we reach the conclusion that the convective heat flux around spherical particles and variations of the heat flux inside spherical particles due to their rotation can be neglected . equation ( [ a - nlf ] ) can be used to model the heat flux enhanced by spherical nano - particles with finite volume fraction up to 25% and any actual value of @xmath62 in fluids at rest and in shear flows . the next question to consider is the effect of the particle shape . we will begin with the case of spheroidal particles in fluids at rest .

[ geometry ] , taking for concreteness @xmath77 . for different orientations of the spheroid ( i.e. different @xmath118 the angle between the temperature gradient vector and the largest spheroid s axis ) , we measure different nusselt numbers : when @xmath129 spheroids with higher conductivities tend to forms a thermal shortcut , thus nu is larger than for @xmath130 , where this shortcut effect is reduced ( fig . [ nuvstheta ] ) . our numerics shows that the dependence of the nusselt number on the spheroid orientation , i.e. nu@xmath131 , for small @xmath8 is well described by a simple formula [ k ] [ nuspheroisboth ] @xmath132 the range of validity of equation ( [ nan - form - factor ] ) was tested by means of a series of simulations at varying angles and volume fractions . the results are reported in figure [ nuvstheta ] . we can conclude that the model in eqs . ( [ spheroid ] ) well represents the heat flux in the presence of resting spheroidal particles in the relevant range of the parameters @xmath62 , @xmath61 and @xmath8 . to apply eqs . ( [ spheroid ] ) for spheroids in a simple shear flow we have to find how the ensemble average @xmath143 depends on @xmath61 . for this purpose we first need to know the orientational distribution function of spheroids in the shear flow . this is a subject of the following subsection . the effect of rotation of elongated spheroidal particles ( @xmath144 ) is very similar to that of spherical ones ( @xmath90 ) , just the parameters @xmath106 , pe@xmath145 and pe@xmath146 of the advanced fit depend on the aspect ratio @xmath61 . as an example , we presented in fig . [ f:9 ] a preliminary result of the computed and fitted nu(pe ) dependence for @xmath147 and @xmath77 . in this case @xmath148 , pe@xmath149 , pe@xmath150 . this is interesting to compare with the respective parameters for @xmath90 and @xmath77 : @xmath151 , pe@xmath152 , pe@xmath153 . one sees that the pe - enhancement of the heat flux with elongated particles is smaller then for spherical ones [ @xmath154 and it saturates at smaller pe : pe@xmath155pe@xmath156 and pe@xmath157 . moreover , the overall conclusion that nu(pe ) is almost pe - independent for pe@xmath158 remains valid , thus , the model developed above in eq .

( [ pdfeq ] ) is very involved , see e.g. refs . @xcite and @xcite . we consider only the small - diffusion limit , see the next subsection . jeffery @xcite has shown that if inertial and brownian motion affects are completely neglected , then the motion of the axis of revolution of a spheroidal particle is described by [ jefforbitseqs ] @xmath198 where @xmath199 with @xmath200 , and the constant of integration @xmath201 is called the ( jeffery ) orbit constant . to analyze the small - diffusion limit we introduce two time - scales . the first one defines the periodic motion that a nano - particle with a finite @xmath61 exhibits : @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the jeffery s period . the second time scale is determined by the inverse shear , @xmath204 . clearly , for large @xmath61 this is a much shorter time scale , so for @xmath205 , @xmath206 it means that the particles spend most of their time near pre- and post - aligned states . if the brownian diffusion is small enough such that @xmath207 one can neglect the effect of the brownian motion on the dynamic motions of particles along jeffery orbits @xcite even during their slow time evolution . in this case the stationary fokker - plank eq .

( [ jefforbitseqstheta ] ) : @xmath222 substituting this function into any one of eqs . ( [ f ] ) we get @xmath223 for a given regime of @xmath61 . this is then substituted in eqs . ( [ pdf1 ] ) , leading finally to a solution of the orientational pdf @xmath224 , which can be used for averaging eqs . ( [ spheroid ] ) in the case of weak brownian motions . as a consistency check of the approach one can consider the trivial case @xmath90 . from eq . ( [ cona-1 ] ) one finds @xmath225 , then from rq . ( [ r=1 ] ) @xmath226 and , finally from ( [ fp-2a ] ) @xmath227 . as the result one has for sphere @xmath228 , as expected . for moderate and strong brownian rotational motion the notion of separate jeffery orbits becomes irrelevant . in this case we need to solve eq . without approximations . once this equation is solved we can compute @xmath229 and substitute the answer in eqs . . to achieve this in the most general case is not a simple task , and here we satisfy ourselves with the two limiting cases of very large and very small rotational diffusion . the second case was discussed above . for the case of very strong rotational diffusion we can use the same eqs . ( [ spheroid ] ) , but averaged with a uniform pdf @xmath230 . this is because the very strong rotational diffusion tends to distribute particles motions around the jeffery orbits uniformly . the corrections up to @xmath231 to such a uniform distribution may be found in ref . @xcite with very strong brownian diffusion , the particles are oriented completely randomly , and @xmath232 . in this case eqs . and ( [ spheroid ] ) give the results reported in fig . [ f:7 ] , upper panels . the upper left panel shows nu vs. @xmath61 dependence for various @xmath62 from @xmath233 to @xmath234 and @xmath235 with volume fraction @xmath236 . these results are rather obvious : for @xmath82 one obtains nu@xmath48 , i.e. no enhancement ; the larger the @xmath62 , the larger the heat flux enhancement ; for any finite @xmath62 there is a saturation of nu@xmath237 for @xmath238 . the value of @xmath64nu@xmath65 may be huge for spheroids ( essentially , rod - like particles at @xmath239 , e.g. for @xmath240 ( diamond in water ) , nu@xmath241 , while for spherical particles @xmath242 , nu@xmath243 at the same volume fraction @xmath244 . the values of nu@xmath245 are bounded , i.e. @xmath246 . the upper right panel shows nu vs. @xmath62 dependence at @xmath236 for three values of @xmath61 : @xmath233 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 . the values of nu@xmath245 are bounded , too : @xmath249 . here , the more elongated particle is ( larger @xmath61 ) , the better the enhancement . and last , but not least : elongated particles may touch each other much easier . as we show in the appendix [ aa : rnphi ] , the basic geometrical requirement that the mean inter - particle distance is less than the largest particle size means that @xmath250 , which is the basic criteria of the dilute limit . the nu@xmath237 dependence for @xmath251 is shown by solid curves , while the region @xmath252 is shown by dashed curves in figs . [ f:7 ] , left panels . provided , @xmath253 at @xmath236 , the enhancement may be still considered as large but not huge : for @xmath77 , the saturation level of ( nu-1 ) is about @xmath254 while for spheres nu@xmath255 . the conclusion in the case of very strong brownian diffusion is that the particles with larger @xmath62 and @xmath61 bring larger heat flux enhancement in the laminar shear flow . to complete the calculations of nu@xmath237 dependence in a weak brownian diffusion limit in the framework of model ( [ spheroid ] ) , we have to find @xmath256 vs. @xmath61 . to make a long story short , we compared in fig . [ fig : pdfs ] , lower panel , the dependence of @xmath257 vs. @xmath61 obtained by numerically solved pdf , eq . ( [ fp-1a ] ) ( see refs . @xcite for more details ) , shown by ( black ) solid curve , and by approximate analytical pdf , eq . ( [ approx - f ] ) , shown by ( red ) dashed curve . as one sees these two dependence coincide within line width . moreover , by careful analysis of various limiting cases , we suggested the following simple model dependence @xmath258 shown in fig . [ fig : pdfs ] , lower panel , as a ( blue ) dash - dotted curve . ( [ cos-2 ] ) fits the exact dependence with an accuracy of 5% . therefore , eqs . ( [ spheroid ] ) and ( [ cos-2 ] ) can be used in our analysis to make predictions on the thermal properties in the limit of small brownian diffusion of fluids laden with spheroidal nano - particles of different aspect ratios and different thermal conductivity ratios with peclet number up to unity . corresponding results are shown in fig . [ fig : nu_nan_jeffery ] , lower panels . + the lower left panel in fig . [ fig : nu_nan_jeffery ] shows nu@xmath237 for different @xmath62 and @xmath244 , at which the maxwell - garnett limit of nu@xmath259 for spherical particles ( @xmath90 ) is @xmath260 . notice , the nu@xmath237 dependence is not monotonic and has a maximum at some @xmath261 , which depends on @xmath62 . the reason for this is the competition of two effects : more elongated nano - particles give larger contribution to the heat flux when their longer axis is aligned with the temperature gradient , which is orthogonal to the velocity gradient ( shear ) in our case . however longer nano - particles are affected more readily by the shear , which tends to orient them in the unfavorable direction orthogonal to the temperature gradient ; then their contribution to the heat flux is even less than the one of the spherical particles ( cf . [ nuvstheta ] ) . again , the values of nu@xmath245 are bounded , i.e. @xmath246 . the lower right panel in fig . [ fig : nu_nan_jeffery ] shows nu@xmath262 for different aspect ratios , @xmath61 at @xmath263 . this is again a consequence of the above described competition . the values of nu are bounded by @xmath264 $ ] . moreover , for @xmath265 the optimal nano - particle shape is spherical . as seen in fig . [ fig : nu_nan_jeffery ] , lower left panel , there exists a maximum of nu@xmath266 for a given @xmath62 . this maximal nusselt number at its maximizing ( optimal ) @xmath267 is shown in fig . [ fig : optimalnu ] , left , as a function of @xmath62 for @xmath268 . for @xmath269 , the maximal nu behaves like @xmath270 , \\ \\ \\varphi = 0.01\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since here @xmath58 , the part in parenthesis may be considered as @xmath8-independent , thus , the fit ( [ maxnufit ] ) may be used at any @xmath271 . the right panel of fig . [ fig : optimalnu ] exhibits a contour - density plot of nu@xmath272 at @xmath268 . thick ( black ) solid and dashed curves show @xmath273 dependence ( solid curve is for @xmath274 , and the dashed one is for @xmath275 ) . the inverse dependence @xmath276 is easy to obtain in a symbolic computation software by solving @xmath277nu@xmath278 at @xmath279 , though , the answer appears to be very cumbersome to be shown here . however , our analysis reveals that @xmath280 , and for @xmath281 and @xmath282 , . @xmath283 this dependence is shown in fig . [ fig : optimalnu ] , right , as a wide - dashed ( white ) curve , which deviates from the analytical solution @xmath284 for @xmath285 . again , since @xmath286 , the fit ( [ roptfit ] ) may be used ) and ( [ spheroid ] ) for @xmath58 , @xmath287 /\\partial r$ ] , which is a function of @xmath245 only . ] at any @xmath271 . in conclusion , we should notice that the rich information about heat flux enhancement , shown in the four panels of fig . [ fig : nu_nan_jeffery ] , is just an illustration of the analytical dependence nu@xmath288 given by the analytical expressions ( [ spheroid ] ) and ( [ cos-2 ] ) . this is an important result of our modeling . we presented a study of the physics of the heat flux in a fluid laden with nanoparticles of different physical properties ( shape , thermal conductivity , etc ) . we developed a new analytical model for the effective thermal properties of dilute nanofluid suspensions . our model accounts for nanoparticle rotation dynamics including the fluid motion around the nanoparticles . we note that our model reproduces the classical maxwell - garnet model in the appropriate static limits . we used a combination of theoretical models and numerical experiments in order to make progress from the simplest case of spherical nanoparticles in a quiescent fluid to the most general case of rotating spheroidal particles in shear flows . the new physical ingredient that we consider is the exact dynamics of particles in shear flows . this constitute a novelty as most of the models introduced so far , to explain the thermal properties of thermal colloids , have focused only on the static properties of the nanoparticle suspension . our model starts from the realization that particles ( spherical or spheroidal ) in the presence of a gradient of the velocity field are induced to rotate . the dynamics of rotation is absolutely non trivial , but it has been studied at length with correspondece ( for the case of a laminar and stationary shear flow ) to the jeffery orbits . the particles rotation dynamics has a double influence on the thermal properties of the nanofluid . first , particles rotation induces fluid motions in the proximity of the particles , this in turn can enhance the thermal fluxes by means of advective motions along the direction of the temperature gradient . second , the jeffery dynamics of particles leads to a statistical distribution of particles orientation that depends on a multitude of parameters , e.g. the particle aspect ratio , the shear intensity as well as on the intensity of thermal fluctuations . the statistical distribution of particle orientation has a dramatic influence on the heat flux : an elongated particle oriented along the temperature gradient increases the thermal flux , while a particle with perpendicular orientation reduces it . the statistical orientation of particles can thus produce a mixed effects with a non - trivial dependence on the particle aspect ratio . more elongated particles can enhance the heat flux because of the stronger contribution when properly aligned to the temperature gradient but , because of shear , more elongated particles are also spending more time in the unfavorable direction ( i.e. perpendicular to the temperature flux ) thus reducing the thermal conductivity of the fluid . by means of numerical approximations we are able to provide closed expressions for the effective conductivity of the fluid under several flow regimes and for several physical parameters our model considerably extends classical models for nanofluid heat transfer , like e.g. the one of maxwell - garnet , and may help to rationalize some of the recent experimental findings . in particular , we suggest that experiments should consider more carefully measurements performed in quiescent and under flowing conditions : the particles dynamics may lead to very different thermal properties in the two cases . finally , the next steps toward a robust predictive models for the heat transfer in nanofluids should include the effect of surface ( kapitza ) resistance and the effect of nanoparticle aggregation . further it would also be extremely important to extend the model to the case of heat flux in turbulent nanofluids as this case is very relevant to many applications . in the presence of turbulence a particular attention should also be paid to the effect on the drag induced by the presence of spherical , rod - like or maybe even deformable nanoparticle inclusions . we acknowledge financial support from the eu fp7 project `` enhanced nano - fluid heat exchange '' ( henix ) contract number 228882 . the numerical simulation of the conjugated heat transfer problem , equations ( [ eq1]-[eq3 ] ) , [隐藏] performed by means of two coupled d3q19 lattice boltzmann ( lb ) equations under the bgk approximation @xcite ( for velocity and temperature fields ) and molecular - dynamics simulations ( for particles motion ) : [ lbeq ] @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the lattice boltzmann distribution function for particles at @xmath291 with velocity @xmath292 ( with @xmath293 for d3q19 ) , and @xmath294 is its equilibrium distribution ; @xmath295 is the distribution functions associated with the temperature and @xmath296 is its equilibrium distribution . the first lb , eq . ( [ lbeq1 ] ) , evolves the fluid flow outside of the rigid particle and its momentum is coupled with the particle boundaries by means of a standard scheme , as proposed by ladd @xcite . the second lb , eq . ( [ lbeq2 ] ) , evolves the temperature field , treated as a passive scalar as proposed in @xcite , solving the conjugated heat transfer problem simply by means of adjusting the thermal conductivity to the correct values in the fluid and inside the particle [ eqn . ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ] . thermal and velocity boundary conditions , at the top and bottom walls , impose the lb populations to equal the equilibrium populations ( corresponding to the desired velocity and temperature ) . this approach can produce small temperature and velocity slip which are kept into account by measuring the effective temperature and velocity profiles , thus increasing the accuracy . the code employed is fully parallelized by means of mpi libraries @xcite thus allowing large system sizes , important to study the influence of finite size effects . density , momentum and temperature are defined locally at @xmath291 as coarse - grained ( in velocity space ) fields of the distribution functions @xmath297 a chapman - enskog expansion @xcite around the local equilibria @xmath298 and @xmath299 @xcite leads to the equations for temperature and momentum ( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) : the streaming step on the left hand side of ( [ lbeq1 ] ) reproduces the inertial terms in the hydrodynamical equations , whereas the diffusive terms ( dissipation and thermal diffusion ) are closely connected to the relaxation ( towards equilibrium ) properties in the right hand side , with @xmath17 and @xmath300 related to the relaxation times @xmath301 , @xmath302 @xcite . consider a spherical particle of radius @xmath45 immersed in a quiescent fluid , in which a constant temperature gradient , @xmath303 , is maintained . the temperature distribution is @xcite : @xmath304\\bm g \\cdot \\bm \\rho\\ , , \\quad r \\geq r\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath305 is the distance from the particle s center . in our couette flow simulations , @xmath306 , but the temperature boundary conditions are different from @xcite . one should expect then deviations close to the walls especially for large particles . the results are presented in fig .

The complexities of healthcare access and financing were clearly shown in a moving life experience of a 13-year old Nigerian orphan named Praise Sunday during a church service on Sunday 12th February 2017 at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN), Lagos, Nigeria. In an armed robbery on May 8th 2016, Praise Sunday tragically lost his mother and sister. During this ordeal, the young boy, whose father passed away several years earlier, sustained life-threatening injuries to his throat. Praise and his extended family members sought medical assistance across Nigeria, depleting their financial means as he underwent seven surgeries. Left with a tracheostomy tube in his throat which enabled him to breathe, he was completely unable to talk and communicated only through writing. In September 2016, they sought aid at The SCOAN, a religious institution known for its extensive charitable endeavours. [隐藏], T.B. Joshua, through the humanitarian arm of his faith-based organization, financed a delicate and complex health procedure carried out in Life Vincent Pallotti Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Specialists, Dr Martin Vanlierde and Professor Mark De Groot, undertook the corrective surgery to restore Praise's ability to both breathe and speak normally again. The procedure was successful and his speedy recovery exceeded expectations. The total cost of Praise's travelling expenses, welfare and medical bills was US$50,000 - all financed by T.B. Joshua's faith-based organisation. During a live broadcast of his story on Emmanuel TV, T.B. Joshua addressed the congregation, encouraging faith leaders and medical doctors to work together to address the societal conundrum, related to healthcare access today. He said: \"If God's servants and doctors work together, there will be no limit to what they can achieve. The medicine doctors use comes from nature and our God is the God of nature.\" The SCOAN has previously financed other medical trips, including a Nigerian policeman who received more than $25,000 to be flown to India for a complicated medical procedure to restore his damaged urinary system after he was shot by gunmen during duty hours.

{"question": "上下文中的'换一种说法'指的是什么？", "answer": "换句话说", "context": "non - linear sigma models [ 1 - 3 ] are prototypes of a remarkable class of integrable two dimensional models which contain an infinite number of conserved local and non - local charges [ 4 - 7 ] . the algebraic relations obeyed by such charges are supposed to be an important ingredient in the complete solution of those models [ 8 - 11 ] . the local charges form an abelian algebra . opposing to that simplicity , the algebra of non - local charges is non - abelian and actually non - linear [ 12 - 28 ] . in ref.[29 ] the @xmath0 sigma model was investigated and a particular set of non - local charges called _ improved _ charges was found to satisfy a cubic algebra related to a yangian structure . in this work we intend to extend that result to the corresponding supersymmetric case [ 30 - 32 ] . the introduction of supersymmetry might have rendered a much more involved algebra [ 33 ] . however , it has been conjectured [ 29,32 ] that , in the sigma model , the algebra of supersymmetric non - local charges would remain the same as in the bosonic theory and we shall present results that confirm such conjecture . this paper is organized as follows . in sect.2 we briefly review the results from the purely bosonic theory . a graphic technique to compute charges and their algebra is introduced in sect.3 . in sect.4 we discuss the supersymmetric model and the main results of the paper . another application of graphic rules is shown in sect . 5 concerning the @xmath0 gross - neveu model . sect.6 is left for conclusions while an appendix contains examples of the graphic technique . the two - dimensional non - linear @xmath0 sigma model can be described by the constrained lagrangean = 12__i^_i , _ i=1^n ^2_i = 1 . associated to the @xmath0 symmetry we have a matrix - valued conserved curvature - free current @xmath1 = 0 \\qquad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose components satisfy the algebra [ 29 ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 identity matrix . above we have introduced the intertwiner field ( j)_ij = _ i_j and the @xmath0 @xmath5-product defined in ref . [ 29 ] as ( ab)_ij , kla_ikb_jl - a_ilb_jk + a_jlb_ik - a_jkb_il . this model is known to have infinite non - local conserved charges . the standard set of charges can be iteratively built up by means of the potential method of brzin _ et . al . _ [ 5 ] . however , in ref . [ 29 ] an alternative set of _ improved _ charges @xmath6 has been defined and it was shown that they obey the non - linear algebra \\ { q^(m)_ij , q^(n)_kl } = ( iq^(n+m ) ) _ ij , kl - _ p=0^m-1_q=0^n-1 ( q^(p ) q^(q ) q^(m+n - p - q-2))_ij , kl . these charges were named _ improved _ because they brought up an algebraic improvement : the non - linear part of the algebra is simply cubic , as opposed to the algebra of the standard charges previously used in the literature [ 14 ] . the jacobi identity and other properties of the improved cubic algebra were thoroughly discussed in ref . but there is a way to abbreviate that algebra , which is the first among the new results of this paper and which will be presented now . .5truecm we shall define a hermitean generator of improved charges q ( ) i + i_n=0^^n+1 q^(n ) , where @xmath7 will be called the spectral parameter . therefore one can summarize the algebra ( 6 ) as follows : i\\ { q_ij(),q_kl ( ) } = ( f ( , ) q()- q ( ) ) _ ij , kl , where f(,)e ( q()q()^-1 -^-1 ) = i - _ m , n=0^^m+1^n+1q^(m)q^(n)^-1 -^-1 . the quadratic non - linearity encoded in @xmath8 can be related to the known yangian structure that underlies this model [ 17 - 26,29 ] . the advantage in writing the algebra as in ( 8) is not only aesthetic . recalling the monodromy matrix of standard charges , and its algebra expressed in terms of the classical @xmath9-matrix , @xmath10 \\quad , \\\\ & & r(\\lambda , \\mu ) = { i_a\\otimes i_a\\over \\lambda ^{-1}-\\mu ^{-1}}\\quad , \\quad [ i_a , i_b ] = f_{abc}i_c \\quad , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remark that the generator @xmath11 and the @xmath12-matrix play similar rles to those of the monodromy matrix and classical @xmath9-matrix in the standard approach [ 17 - 26 ] . we do not fully understand the relationship between ( 8) and ( 10 ) but we expect to be able to use this analogy to establish a precise translation between the different sets of charges [ 35 ] . we also hope that a complete knowledge about the conserved charges and their algebra will become an decisive ingredient in off - shell scattering calculations . .5truecm now let us consider the graphic methods announced in the introduction . we recall that in ref . [ 29 ] the improved charges were constructed by means of an iterative algebraic algorithm that uses @xmath13 as a step - generator , as indicated by the relation ( iq^(n+1 ) ) = linear part of \\{q^(1),q^(n ) } . after a tedious calculation \" the authors in ref . [ 29 ] managed to construct the charges @xmath14 and their algebra up to @xmath15 . in the next section we will present a _ graphic _ method that makes the calculation simpler , less tedious and convenient for a further supersymmetric extension . let us associate white and black semicircles to the @xmath0 current components , j -.1 cm 2truecm j -.1 cm a continuous line and an oriented line to the identity and the anti - derivative operator respectively , i .07 cm 2truecm 2 .07 cm the operator @xmath16 above follows the same convention adopted in ref . [ 29 ] , a(x ) = 12 y ( x - y)a(y ) , ( x)= . below one finds some diagrams and the corresponding expressions : @xmath17 we have noticed [ 29 ] that every improved charge can be written as an integral over symmetrized chains of @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s connected by the operator @xmath20 . therefore we can associate a diagram to each improved charge , as exemplified by the second non - local charge @xmath21 : q^(2)=dx @xmath22 if one is interested in constructing charges , there is an iterative graphic procedure , inspired by the lessons taken from ref . [ 29 ] and which will be described now . consider the following properties : .3truecm \\(a ) the improved non - local charges have the general form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a combination of terms which one can always write as j _ 2(j_s+s^^tj _ ) , where @xmath25 is some chain and @xmath26 its transposed . .5truecm ( b ) the algebraic definition of improved charges is ( iq^(n+1))_ij , kl= linear part of \\{q_ij^(1),q_kl^(n ) } and we note that the linear part of @xmath27 comes exclusively from terms like dx ( \\{q_ij^(1),(j_)_ka}2s_al-(k l ) ) . .5truecm ( c ) using the definition of @xmath13 and the elementary current algebra and dropping non - linear terms , we verify that dx\\{q_ij^(1),(j__0)_ka}2s_al - ( k l ) =( i dx[j__12s+j__02(j__02s ) + 2js ] ) _ ij , kl . @xmath28 dx \\{q_ij^(1),(j__1)_ka}2s_al - ( k l ) =( i dx[2j__0j2s+j__0 2(j__1s ) ] ) _ ij , kl . @xmath29 where some new symbols were introduced , @xmath30 -.1 cm 1truecm 1truecm -.1 cm 2= i the previous expressions justify the following prescription : .3truecm \\i ) we start from the diagram of @xmath14 . .5truecm ii ) then we replace the left tip \" of each chain according to the rules : .5truecm iii ) the resulting diagram corresponds to @xmath31 . .5truecm we remark that the substitution rules above can be directly read from the following basic brackets : @xmath32 in addition , one should not forget the constraints satisfied by the @xmath0 current @xmath33 , given below , _ + = j _ 2truecm -.1 cm 0.5 cm 2j__1js= ( j__1s+js ) 2truecm -.1 cm the half - white / half - black semicircle means @xmath34 or @xmath19 generically . we have tested the efficiency of this method : comparing to the explicit algebraic algorithm in ref . [ 29 ] we have taken much less time and space to construct the improved charges . for the sake of clarity we have gathered a few examples in appendix a. .3truecm we have also developed a diagrammatic technique to calculate the algebra itself . it can be seen as a set of contraction rules between the chains that constitute the charges . indeed , in computing the algebra of non - local charges we have to consider all possible contractions \" ( i.e. dirac brackets ) between symmetrized chains . after some partial integrations we end up with elementary contractions of the following general kind : s_ia(x)t_bj(x ) \\{(j_)_ab(x),(j_)_cd(y ) } u_kc(y)v_dl(y ) -(i j ) - ( k l ) . the current algebra ( 3 ) tells us that a contraction @xmath35 may produce a current - like term @xmath36 or a schwinger term . let us discuss the first kind , in which case ( 28 ) produces 4 terms : @xmath37_{ij , kl } \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can associate each of the 4 terms above to one of the 4 possible contractions between the 2 pairs of symmetrized chains . in the presence of a schwinger term we must take into account extra contributions involving the intertwiner and partial integrations . in any event , the contractions between chains can be resumed by the following rules : .5truecm * step 1 : choice * .2truecm in calculating @xmath38 we take one chain from @xmath39 and other from @xmath14 . then we pick up the internal \" current components we intend to contract . this is symbolized by the generic diagram below : .5truecm * step 2 : isolation * .2truecm in each chain we must localize \" the current components chosen in step 1 . this was explicitly made in ( 28 ) by means of partial integrations . within the diagrams this is achieved by inverting some arrows until all of them are pointing towards the chosen semicircle ( i.e. the current component we are isolating ) . eventually a minus sign will be picked up , depending on the number of inversions . finally have have this sort of diagrams : .2truecm the next step is just a graphic bending of chains , as a preparation to the final contraction . the chains from ( 31 ) should be bended in the following way : notice that the sub - chains @xmath40 and @xmath41 were transposed as eq . ( 31 ) demands . actually the graphic bending implies the transposition , as exemplified below where the transposed current components are naturally represented as @xmath42 .5truecm * step 4 : contraction * .2truecm finally we perform the contraction in ( 32 ) according to the rules below : where we introduced a symbol corresponding to the @xmath5-product , -.6 cm = ( ab)=(ba ) . for instance , a typical contraction between @xmath43 components would be @xmath44 = dx(su^^tt^^tj__0v ) . of course one must repeat all steps for every possible contraction . .2truecm the current @xmath33 obeys another constraint [ 27 ] involving the @xmath5-product , namely ( j_j)= 0 = -.6 cm which must also be taken into account . .3truecm we mention that the elementary contractions in ( 35 ) are nothing but the graphic representation of the current algebra ( 3 ) , where the diagrams containing the intertwiner field come from schwinger terms followed by partial integrations . these rules were applied to compute various brackets and in all cases the algebra ( 6 ) was confirmed . one can also find an example in appendix a. the most remarkable outcome of this graphic procedure is that it poses an easy and straightforward way to the supersymmetric extension and possibly other generalizations . the supersymmetric non - linear @xmath0 sigma model is defined [ 30 - 32 ] by the lagrangean _ s=__i^_i+ _ i /_i+ ( _ i_i)^2 , where @xmath45 are scalars and @xmath46 are majorana fermions satisfying the constraints _ i=1^n_i^2 - 1=0 , _ i=1^n_i_i=0 . we also have a conserved @xmath0 current @xmath47 which can be split into bosonic and fermionic parts @xmath48 whose curvature obeys the equation f _ = _ j_-_j_+2[j_,j_]= -(_b_- _ b _ ) . even though its curvature is not null , one can construct non - local conserved charges out of @xmath49 [ 30,31 ] . here we shall deal with an algebraic procedure to derive these charges . therefore it is necessary to start from the elementary @xmath0 current algebra , listed below , @xmath50_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y ) \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(j_{{}_0})_{ij}(x),(j_{{}_1})_{kl}(y)\\}= ( i\\circ j_{{}_1})_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y)+(i\\circ j)_{ij , kl}(y)\\delta'(x - y ) \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(j_{{}_1})_{ij}(x),(j_{{}_1})_{kl}(y)\\}=0 \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(b_{{}_0})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_0})_{kl}(y)\\}= [ ( i\\circ b_{{}_0})-(j\\circ b_{{}_0})]_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y ) \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(b_{{}_0})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_1})_{kl}(y)\\}= [ ( i\\circ b_{{}_1})-(j\\circ b_{{}_1})]_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y ) \\quad , \\\\ & & \\{(b_{{}_1})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_1})_{kl}(y)\\}= [ ( i\\circ b_{{}_0})-(j\\circ b_{{}_0})]_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y ) \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(j_{{}_0})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_0})_{kl}(y)\\}= ( j\\circ b_{{}_0})_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y ) \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(j_{{}_0})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_1})_{kl}(y)\\}= ( j\\circ b_{{}_1})_{ij , kl}(x)\\delta(x - y ) \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(j_{{}_1})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_0})_{kl}(y)\\}=0 \\quad , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{(j_{{}_1})_{ij}(x),(b_{{}_1})_{kl}(y)\\}=0 \\quad , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the intertwiner and the @xmath5-product were already defined in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . the @xmath0 local charge and the first non - local charge are given [ 30,31 ] by the integrals @xmath51 some other supersymmetric _ standard _ non - local charges can be found in the literature [ 30 - 32 ] . however , as in the bosonic case , we are searching for _ improved _ charges satisfying the simplest algebra . using the algebraic method proposed in ref . [ 29 ] we have computed the improved charges and their brackets up to @xmath52 , finding the _ same cubic algebra _ given by ( 6 ) . calculation is hopelessly longer than in the bosonic theory , but we have been able to develop some graphic rules which rather simplified our work . this diagrammatic method is a direct extension of the one proposed for the bosonic theory . for instance , one can show that the supersymmetric step - generator @xmath13 satisfies the following algebraic relations : @xmath53 as in the bosonic model ( recall eqs.(23 - 25 ) ) these relations lead us to the proper transformation rules for the construction of charges . one can use the following iterative procedure : .3truecm \\i ) we propose the symbolic notation @xmath54 b__0 -.1 cm , b__1 -.1 cm @xmath55 @xmath56 .5truecm ii ) we take the diagram associated to @xmath14 and replace the left tip \" of each chain as follows : these transformations are a direct translation of eqs . ( 45 - 48 ) . .5truecm iii ) after using the constraints on @xmath33 and @xmath57 you will have the diagram of @xmath31 . .5truecm in order to calculate the algebra between the non - local charges , one should follow the same algorithm ( choice , isolation , bending and contraction ) , using the contraction rules below @xmath58 @xmath59 which is the graphic version of the algebra ( 43 ) . we also have a new constraint , b_j = jb_= 0 = -.1 cm to be added to the list in ( 26,27,38 ) . as before , the half - white / half - black triangle means @xmath60 or @xmath61 in general . .5truecm we have used this procedure to construct several charges and confirmed the algebra ( 6 ) . this is actually the main result of this paper , confirming previous conjectures . .3truecm to complete the algebraic analysis , we have also considered the conserved supersymmetry current and charge , given by @xmath62 using the equations of motion , we have checked that \\ { q , q^(n ) } = 0 , n0 which means that every non - local charge is invariant under supersymmetry on - shell as already pointed in ref . therefore the non - local charges in the supersymmetric sigma model are all bosonic . however we must stress that this is not a general property : for instance , in ref . [ 34 ] one finds an integrable supersymmetric theory the supersymmetric two boson hierarchy containing fermionic non - local charges whose graded algebra exhibits cubic terms similar to those of eq . it would be very interesting to develop graphic rules for this kind of model [ 35 ] . this model consists of an @xmath63-plet of majorana fermions transforming as a fundamental representation of the @xmath0 group , with a quartic interaction . its lagrangean reads [ 7 ] _ _ gn = _ ( _ i_i)^2 , and it can be regarded as the limit of null bosonic field ( @xmath64 ) in the supersymmetric model ( 39 ) notice that the constraints ( 40 ) disappear . the noether current associated to the @xmath0 rotations is ( b_)_ij = -i_i__i , _ b^=0 and it satisfies the curvature - free condition _ b_-_b_+ [ b_,b _ ] = 0 and the algebraic relations @xmath65 as before , we may construct an infinite number of conserved non - local currents using the potential algorithm : we consider a conserved current @xmath66 and the corresponding potential @xmath67 , b_^(n)= _ then we define the current @xmath68 as b_^(n+1 ) = 2 ( _ + b _ ) ^(n ) . the properties ( 56 ) and ( 57 ) imply that @xmath68 is also conserved . starting out with @xmath69 we find an infinite number of conserved charges @xmath70 . after applying this algorithm to build up some of them , it is straightforward to check that this method is equivalent to the following graphic procedure : one chooses some symbols to represent @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for instance , b__0 -.1 cm 2truecm b__1 -.1 cm then one takes the sequence of chains associated to @xmath14 and uses the replacement rules for left - tips on the other hand , this is precisely the limit @xmath71 of the transformation rules ( 50 ) in the supersymmetric theory . .3truecm this provides an alternative derivation of the graphic rules to construct charges in the gross - neveu model . moreover it implies that those charges defined by the algorithm ( 60 ) are actually the improved charges and thus they must obey the cubic algebra ( 6 ) . diagrammatic methods are frequently used in physics to simplify long calculations and so we have proposed a graphic procedure to construct and compute the algebra of non - local charges in non - [隐藏] sigma models . applying such procedure we have been able to verify that the ( improved ) non - local charges in the supersymmetric @xmath0 sigma model obey a cubic yangian - like algebra which can be expressed as in eq . .2truecm one could easily recover the bosonic model from the supersymmetric theory by taking the no - fermion limit @xmath72 . moreover , the @xmath0 invariant gross - neveu model can be obtained after erasing the bosonic fields ( @xmath64 ) . the improved charges in these models may be different but their algebra is exactly the same . in the gross - neveu model , the improved charges could be computed by means of two different methods and therefore the corresponding graphic rules could be confirmed and further understood . we expect to find a similar confirmation in the sigma models but the presence of the intertwiner field within the diagrams has impeded us so far . .2truecm it is also interesting to consider the inclusion of wess - zumino terms , which modify the current algebra ( see for instance ref . [ 28,29 ] ) and derive the corresponding graphic rules . this problem and the general application of diagrammatic methods to integrable theories is presently under investigation [ 35 ] . 2truecm * acknowledgements * .5truecm we would like to thank e. abdalla and m.c.b . abdalla for helpful comments . we also thank j.c . brunelli for suggestions and for his participation in the early stages of this work .

{"question": "上下文中的'用来询问事情或事物的英文疑问词'指的是什么？", "answer": "What", "context": "[隐藏] is a Termite Bond? What are Bonds Good For? What is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost? >> What is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost? Wondering how much is your termite bond? You found termite damage to your house, went through the whole process of hiring an exterminator to inspect the damage, then had several treatments to take care of the problem. This shouldn’t be the end of your efforts to eradicate termites from your home, however, since a house with previous termite damage is likely to experience a recurrence of the infestation at some point in the future. People in places like Alabama are fond of saying, “There are two kinds of houses: those with termites and those that will have them.” How can you keep up with extermination costs that potentially recur every year? Look into the benefits of a termite bond. What is a termite bond? It is a contract or guarantee entered into between a homeowner/business owner and their exterminator. After a building is treated for termites, a bond ensures future inspection and treatment at no cost to the customer beyond the bond renewal fee. Will the cost of the bond amount to less than the expected expenses should reinfestation occur? Does the bond cover both inspection and full retreatment? Will the bond cover any damages related to termites causing future damage to the house? Are you in an area with different kinds of termites? If so, will a bond cover all types of termites returning in the future? If retreatment is needed and the new infestation is more extensive, will the company cover measures beyond the initial service (i.e. if only liquid is used the first time will they cover fumigation in the future)? In order to understand how a termite bond works, you should know the basics of the termite extermination process. The first step is a thorough inspection to determine the type of termite, location of the infestation, and the extent of the damage. All of these factors taken together will determine the method used. Serious infestations usually require fumigation. In fact, a lot of title companies require fumigation before a home with any kind of termite damage is sold to a new owner. Typically, termite fumigations take around three days to complete. The basic termite bond should cover a yearly inspection and, if termites return, future extermination costs. Initial extermination may be as low as $1,500 for a small area and basic treatment, and a large home with a significant problem can cost up to $5,000 to treat. In the first case, a bond fee of $200 per year may not be worth it, especially if you live in an area with infrequent infestations. Wise Geek features a concise article on termite bonds that recommends comparing the annual cost of a bond with the price of re-extermination for your house. You cannot assume a termite bond will cover any and all damages caused by future infestations. Some bonds are for extermination costs only while others promise to repair a limited amount of damages to your house if the termites return within a certain time frame. The kind of termite in your house can affect the bond as well, says Orkin; if the initial treatment was for one type of termite and another kind re-infests your house, the bond may not apply. This may also be the case if the first time you have an issue in your basement, for example, but the next time find termites on the outside of your foundation. If you have questions about termites bonds because you are buying or selling a house, look closely at the bond’s transfer limitations. For buyers purchasing a home with a previous termite problem, make sure the bond can and is transferred to you as the new homeowner. This way you are not on the hook for extermination costs that should have been covered by the previous owner. You will, however, need to take on the responsibility of the bond’s annual fees to continue the contract with the exterminator. As a home seller, you should invest in a bond to increase the chances you will sell a home with termite damages. Homeowners’ insurance does not cover termite damage– a reinfestation too soon after the sale of your house could leave you paying the new homeowners’ extermination bills. Savvy buyers may not even consider buying from you without a bond in place. With a transferable bond, you can hand off the agreement to the new homeowner, they take on the cost of the bond, and you don’t have to worry about the termites coming back to a home you no longer own. If you’ve recently had your home exterminated for termites and did not arrange for a bond with your pest control company, you may want to contact them and see if you can still sign an agreement. If you are buying or selling a home with previous termite problem and don’t know have never heard of a termite bond before, definitely educate yourself and make a termite bond part of your home buying or selling process. Just make sure the terms are agreeable to you and the needs of your house. In answer to the question, “What is a termite bond?” you could say simply it is a contract that guarantees future treatment if termites return. Another way to see it is an added form of insurance that protects the value and condition of your house and other buildings. You will need to decide for yourself if the continuing, nominal cost of a termite bond is worth it; many people who live in areas where termites are a constant problem and go through having to pay for termite extermination once see the value in it.", "type": "riddle", "id": "webpuzzle_484", "difficulty": "easy", "source_doc": "What is a Termite Bond?

Typically for a small model and in the spirit of the traditional kits, profiles are simplified and adjusted from the original and a relatively large propeller is used. This is done so that the model is light and stable enough to fly on its own, is simple in construction and can work with the rubber motor. These adjustments have been done with care and sensitivity so that the shape and spirit of the original aircraft is preserved as much as possible. Also in the spirit of the traditional kits, additional items required to build the model are things that can be found in the kitchen drawer or are easily available on the high street. A new series of rubber-band powered flying models from Lyonaeec featuring a range of historic aircraft and aircraft designs. This model is modelled from the outline of the North American Aviation P-51 Mustang, a design which broke new ground in aerodynamic efficiency of wing design in addition to its' outstanding success as a fighter aircraft. Manufactured from modern light-weight foam materials the design follows traditional balsa glider design with a flat main fuselage with a lengthwise for the rubber band connecting to the prop and slot mountings for the main and tail wings. This kit is designed for you to build a traditionally constructed, rubber powered, free flight model of a Daimler Benz powered ME109E (Emil). ME109Es were painted in a myriad of schemes, most of which were complicated and not in block colours and would be difficult to achieve with a rubber powered scale model such as this. Therefore, the kit is provided with the materials (other than paints) to complete a simple block colour scheme to capture the spirit of the aircraft as would have fought in The Battle of Britain. Alternatively, you can decide to do your own favourite or more complicated scheme if you wish. Power is provided by rubber strip motor that is wound up before flight. Free flight means just that - once the model is launched, it is on its own. It must follow a predetermined flight path established when the model is initially adjusted for flight or \"trimmed\". This type of traditional building technique and flying requires a degree of patience and skill, but is extremely rewarding. This type of traditional building technique and flying requires a degree of patience and skill ñ but is extremely rewarding. Although not a \"serious\" sports glider model, if built correctly and in the right hands, the Osprey is capable of surprisingly long flights. In the spirit of the old kits additional items required to build the model are things that can be found in the kitchen drawer or are easily available on the high street. A modern recreation of a classic design this kit includes glue to get you going. This kit is designed for you to build a traditionally constructed, rubber powered, free flight model of a P-51D Mustang factory serial number 44-13557 as delivered to 355th fighter group based at Steeple Morden, England circa July 1944.

This is a simple but striking scheme, but you can decide to do your own favourite or more complicated scheme if you wish. There are plenty to choose from - USAAF Mustangs were often brightly painted and highly individual to the pilot. This kit is designed for you to build a traditionally constructed, rubber-powered, free-flight model of a 1917 Triplane of No.1 Squadron RNAS. This is a simple but striking scheme, but you can decide to do your own favourite or more complicated scheme if you wish as there are many triplane schemes to choose from. The No.1 Squadron RNAS (latterly 201 Squadron RAF) flew Triplanes between December 1916 and December 1917 over the Western Front before being belatedly re-equipped with Sopwith Camels. The Sopwith Triplane is just one of a series of kits designed and manufactured by the Vintage Model Company. Aeromodelling was very popular from the 1950s until the 1980s and following a decline and the loss of UK manufacturers such as FROG, KeilKraft and Veron, a revival is now underway. The advent of modern technology such as laser cutting of parts and the growth of the internet giving access to information on the skills and techniques required to successfully build and fly these models, means new enthusiasts are discovering the joys of aeromodelling every day. There are 6 styles of historical biplane and triplane in this Series, they are made of wood,engineering plastics, stickers, metal,GPPS foamed plastics,and rubber band. Simple to construct, no glue or paints required. Length 420 mm, Wing span 450 mm. Length 420 mm, Wing span 450mm.
